Heere folwen the wordes betwene the Hoost and the Millere
Here follow the words between the Host and the Miller
3109  When the Knight had thus told his tale,
3110  In all the company there was no one young nor old
3111  Who did not say it was a noble story
3112  And worthy to draw into memory,
3113  And especially the gentlefolk every one.
3114  Our Host laughed and swore, "As I may move about (I swear),
3115  This goes well; the bag is opened.
3116  Let's see now who shall tell another tale;
3117  For truly the game is well begun.
3118  Now tell you, sir Monk, if you can,
3119  Something to equal the Knight's tale."
3120  The Miller, who for drunkenness was all pale,
3121  So that he hardly sat upon his horse,
3122  He would not doff neither hood nor hat,
3123  Nor give preference to any man out of courtesy,
3124  But in Pilate's voice he began to cry,
3125  And swore, "By (Christ's) arms, and by blood and bones,
3126  I know a noble tale for this occasion,
3127  With which I will now requite the Knight's tale."
3128  Our Host saw that he was drunk on ale,
3129  And said, "Wait, Robin, my dear brother;
3130  Some better man shall first tell us another.
3131  Wait, and let us act properly."
3132  "By God's soul," said he, "that will not I;
3133  For I will speak or else go my way."
3134  Our Host answered, "Tell on, in the devil's name!
3135  Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."
3136  "Now listen," said the Miller, "everyone!
3137  But first I make a protestation
3138  That I am drunk; I know it by my sound.
3139  And therefore if that I misspeak or say (amiss),
3140  Blame it on ale of Southwerk, I you pray.
3141  For I will tell a legend and a life
3142  Both of a carpenter and of his wife,
3143  How a clerk has set the carpenter's cap (fooled him)."

3144  The Reeve answered and said, "Hold your tongue!
3145  Let be thy ignorant drunken ribaldry.
3146  It is a sin and also a great folly
3147  To slander any man, or defame him,
3148  And also to bring wives in such ill fame.
3149  Thou canst say enough about other things."

3150  This drunken Miller spoke very quickly in reply
3151  And said, "Dear brother Oswald,
3152  He who has no wife, he is no cuckold.
3153  But I say not therefore that thou art one;
3154  There are very good wives, many a one,
3155  And ever a thousand good against one bad.
3156  Thou knowest that well thyself, unless thou art mad.
3157  Why art thou angry with my tale now?
3158  I have a wife, by God, as well as thou;
3159  Yet I would not, for the oxen in my plow,
3160  Take upon me more than enough (trouble),
3161  As to believe of myself that I were one (a cuckold);
3162  I will believe well that I am not one.
3163  A husband must not be inquisitive
3164  Of God's secrets, nor of his wife.
3165  So long as he can find God's plenty there,
3166  Of the rest he needs not enquire."

3167  What more should I say, but this Miller
3168  He would not refrain from speaking for any man,
3169  But told his churl's tale in his manner.
3170  I regret that I must repeat it here.
3171  And therefore every respectable person I pray,
3172  For God's love, think not that I speak
3173  Out of evil intention, but because I must repeat
3174  All their tales, be they better or worse,
3175  Or else (I must) falsify some of my material.
3176  And therefore, whoever does not want to hear it,
3177  Turn over the leaf and choose another tale;
3178  For he shall find enough, of every sort,
3179  Of historical matter that concerns nobility,
3180  And also morality and holiness.
3181  Blame not me if you choose amiss.
3182  The Miller is a churl; you know this well.
3183  So was the Reeve also and many others,
3184  And ribaldry they told, both of the two.
3185  Think about this, and don't blame me;
3186  And also people should not take a joke too seriously.

The Miller's Tale

Heere bigynneth the Millere his tale.
Here begins The Miller's Tale.

3187  There was once dwelling at Oxford
3188  A rich churl, who took in boarders,
3189  And of his craft he was a carpenter.
3190  With him there was dwelling a poor scholar,
3191  Who had learned the arts curriculum, but all his desire
3192  Was turned to learning astrology,
3193  And he knew a certain (number of) of astronomical operations,
3194  To determine by scientific calculations,
3195  If men asked him, in specific (astronomical) hours
3196  When men should have drought or else showers,
3197  Or if people asked him what should happen
3198  Concerning every thing; I can not reckon them all.

3199  This clerk was called clever Nicholas.
3200  Of secret love he knew and of its satisfaction;
3201  And moreover he was sly and very discreet,
3202  And like a maiden meek in appearance.
3203  A room had he in that hostelry
3204  Alone, without any company,
3205  Very elegantly strewn with sweet-smelling herbs;
3206  And he himself as sweet as is the root
3207  Of licorice or any zedoary (a ginger-like herb).
3208  His Almagest, and books large and small,
3209  His astrolabe, belonging to his art (of astronomy),
3210  His counting stones (for his abacus) lie neatly apart,
3211  Arranged on shelves at his bed's head;
3212  His linen press covered with a red woolen cloth;
3213  And all above there lay a fine psaltery,
3214  On which at night he made melody
3215  So sweetly that all the room rang;
3216  And "The Angel to the Virgin" he sang;
3217  And after that he sang the King's Tune.
3218  Very often his merry throat was blessed.
3219  And thus this sweet clerk spent his time
3220  Living on his friends' support and his (own) income.

3221  This carpenter had recently wedded a wife,
3222  Whom he loved more than his life;
3223  She was eighteen years of age.
3224  Jealous he was, and held her narrowly in confinement,
3225  For she was wild and young, and he was old
3226  And believed himself likely to be a cuckold.
3227  He knew not Cato, for his wit was rude,
3228  Who advised that man should wed his equal.
3229  Men should wed according to their status in life,
3230  For youth and old age are often in conflict.
3231  But since he was fallen in the snare,
3232  He must endure, like other folk, his troubles.

3233  Fair was this young wife, and moreover
3234  As any weasel was her body graceful and slender.
3235  A belt she wore, with decorative strips all of silk,
3236  An apron as white as morning milk
3237  Upon her loins, full of many a flounce.
3238  White was her smock, and embroidered all in front
3239  And also behind, around her collar,
3240  With coal-black silk, within and also without.
3241  The ribbons of her white cap
3242  Were of the same color as her collar;
3243  Her headband broad of silk, and set very high.
3244  And surely she had a wanton eye;
3245  Her two eyebrows were plucked very thin,
3246  And those were bent and black as any sloe.
3247  She was much more blissful to look upon
3248  Than is the new early-ripe pear tree,
3249  And softer than the wool is of a sheep.
3250  And by her girdle hung a purse of leather,
3251  Tasseled with silk and ornamented with latten "pearls."
3252  In all this world, to seek up and down,
3253  There is no man so wise that he could imagine
3254  So lovely a little doll or such a wench.
3255  Much brighter was the shining of her complexion
3256  Than the newly minted noble in the Tower.
3257  But of her song, it was as loud and lively
3258  As any swallow sitting on a barn.
3259  Moreover she could skip and play,
3260  Like any kid or calf following its mother.
3261  Her mouth was sweet as ale and honey or mead,
3262  Or a hoard of apples laid in hay or heather.
3263  Skittish she was, as is a spirited colt,
3264  Tall as a mast, and straight as an arrow.
3265  A brooch she wore upon her low collar,
3266  As broad as is the boss of a shield.
3267  Her shoes were laced high on her legs.
3268  She was a primrose, a pig's eye (a flower),
3269  For any lord to lay in his bed,
3270  Or yet for any good yeoman to wed.

3271  Now, sir, and again, sir, it so happened
3272  That one day this clever Nicholas
3273  Happened with this young wife to flirt and play,
3274  While her husband was at Oseneye,
3275  For clerks are very subtle and very clever;
3276  And intimately he caught her by her crotch,
3277  And said, "Indeed, unless I have my will,
3278  For secret love of thee, sweetheart, I die."
3279  And held her hard by the thigh,
3280  And said, "Sweetheart, love me immediately
3281  Or I will die, so save me God!"
3282  And she sprang as a colt does when restrained,
3283  And with her head she twisted fast away,
3284  And said, "I will not kiss thee, by my faith!
3285  Why, let me be!" said she. "Let me be, Nicholas,
3286  o
u
t
,
â†”
o
w
'
and
allas'!
Or I will cry
o
u
t
,
h
e
l
p
'
and
alas'!
3287  Take away your hands, for your courtesy!"

3288  This Nicholas began to cry for mercy,
3289  And spoke so fair, and pressed his suit so fast,
3290  That she granted him her love at the last,
3291  And swore her oath, by Saint Thomas of Kent,
3292  That she will be at his commandment,
3293  When she may well espy her opportunity.
3294  "My husband is so full of jealousy
3295  That unless you wait patiently and are secretive,
3296  I know right well I am as good as dead," said she.
3297  "You must been very secret in this matter."

3298  "No, care thee not about that," said Nicholas.
3299  "A clerk had badly wasted his time (studying),
3300  If he could not outwit a carpenter."
3301  And thus they are agreed and sworn
3302  To wait for a time, as I have told before.

3303  When Nicholas had done thus every bit
3304  And well patted her about the loins,
3305  He kissed her sweetly and takes his psaltery,
3306  And plays fast, and makes melody.

3307  Then it thus happened, that to the parish church,
3308  Christ's own works to do,
3309  This good wife went on a holiday.
3310  Her forehead shone as bright as any day,
3311  It was so washed when she left her work.
3312  Now was there of that church a parish clerk,
3313  Who was called Absolon.
3314  Curly was his hair, and as the gold it shone,
3315  And stretched out like a fan large and broad;
3316  Very straight and even lay his elegant parted hair.
3317  His complexion was ruddy, his eyes gray as a goose.
3318  With St. Paul's window carved on his shoes,
3319  In red hose he went elegantly.
3320  Clad he was very trimly and properly
3321  All in a tunic of a light blue;
3322  Very fair and thick are the laces set.
3323  And over that he had a gay surplice
3324  As white as is the blossom upon the branch.
3325  A merry lad he was, so save me God.
3326  Well could he draw blood, and cut hair and shave,
3327  And make a charter of land or a legal release.
3328  In twenty different ways could he trip and dance
3329  After the school of Oxford as it was then,
3330  And with his legs kick to and fro,
3331  And play songs on a small fiddle,
3332  To which he some times sang a loud high treble;
3333  And he could play as well on a guitar.
3334  In all the town there was no brew house nor tavern
3335  That he did not visit with his entertainment,
3336  Where any merry barmaid was.
3337  But to say the truth, he was somewhat squeamish
3338  About farting, and fastidious in his speech.

3339  This Absolon, who was elegant and gay,
3340  Goes with a censer on the holiday,
3341  Censing the wives of the parish eagerly;
3342  And many a lovely look he cast on them,
3343  And especially on this carpenter's wife.
3344  To look on her he thought a merry life,
3345  She was so attractive and sweet and flirtatious.
3346  I dare well say, if she had been a mouse,
3347  And he a cat, he would have grabbed her at once.
3348  This parish clerk, this elegant Absolon,
3349  Has in his heart such a love-longing
3350  That of no wife took he any offering;
3351  For courtesy, he said, he would have none.

3352  The moon, when it was night, very brightly shone,
3353  And Absolon his guitar has taken;
3354  For the sake of love he intended to stay awake.
3355  And forth he goes, elegant and amorous,
3356  Until he came to the carpenter's house
3357  A little after cocks had crowed,
3358  And took his place up by a casement window
3359  That was upon the carpenter's wall.
3360  He sings in his voice gentle and high,
3361  "Now, dear lady, if it be thy will,
3362  I pray yow that you will have pity on me,"
3363  Very well in harmony with his guitar-playing.
3364  This carpenter awoke, and heard him sing,
3365  And spoke unto his wife, and said at once,
3366  "What! Alison! Hearest thou not Absolon,
3367  That chants thus next to our bedroom's wall?"
3368  And she answered her husband immediately,
3369  "Yes indeed, God knows, John, I hear it every bit."

3370  This goes on; what more would you have?
3371  From day to day this elegant Absolon
3372  So woos her that he is in a sorry state.
3373  He stays awake all the night and all the day;
3374  He combs his flowing locks, and dressed himself elegantly;
3375  He woos her by go-betweens and agents,
3376  And swore he would be her own servant;
3377  He sings, trilling like a nightingale;
3378  He sent her sweetened wine, mead, and spiced ale,
3379  And wafers, piping hot out of the fire;
3380  And, because she was a townie, he offered money;
3381  For some folk will be won for riches,
3382  And some by force, and some for noble character.
3383  Sometimes, to show his agility and skill,
3384  He plays Herod upon a high stage.
3385  But what good does it do him in this case?
3386  She so loves this clever Nicholas
3387  That Absolon may go whistle;
3388  He had for his labor nothing but scorn.
3389  And thus she makes Absolon her fool,
3390  And turns all his earnestness into a joke.
3391  Very true is this proverb, it is no lie,
3392  Men say right thus: "Always the nearby sly one
3393  Makes the distant loved one to be disliked."
3394  For though Absolon be crazed or angry,
3395  Because he was far from her sight,
3396  This nearby Nicholas cast him in the shadow.

3397  Now bear thyself well, thou clever Nicholas,
3398  For Absolon may wail and sing "alas."

3399  And so it happened on a Saturday,
3400  This carpenter was gone to Osenay;
3401  And clever Nicholas and Alisoun
3402  Are agreed on this plan,
3403  That Nicholas shall devise a trick
3404  To beguile this hapless jealous husband;
3405  And if it so be the game went right,
3406  She should sleep in his arms all night,
3407  For this was his desire and hers also.
3408  And right away, without more words,
3409  This Nicholas no longer would tarry,
3410  But has carried very quietly unto his chamber
3411  Both food and drink for a day or two,
3412  And told her to say to her husband,
3413  If he asked about Nicholas,
3414  She should say she knew not where he was;
3415  Of all that day she saw him not with eye;
3416  She believed that he was ill,
3417  Because, for no shout could her maid call him,
3418  He would not answer for anything that might befall.

3419  This goes on all that same Saturday,
3420  That Nicholas still in his chamber lay,
3421  And ate and slept, or did what he pleased,
3422  Until Sunday, when the sun goes to rest.
3423  This hapless carpenter has great marvel
3424  About Nicholas, or what thing might ail him,
3425  And said, "I am afraid, by Saint Thomas,
3426  Things are not right with Nicholas.
3427  God forbid that he should suddenly die!
3428  This world is now very ticklish, surely.
3429  I saw today a corpse carried to church
3430  That just now, on last Monday, I saw him work.

3431  "Go up," he said unto his servant at once,
3432  "Call at his door, or knock with a stone.
3433  Look how it is, and tell me quickly."

3434  This servant goes up very resolutely,
3435  And at the chamber door while he stood,
3436  He cried and knocked as if he were crazy,
3437  "What, hey! What do you, master Nicholay?
3438  How can you sleep all the long day?"

3439  But all for naught; he heard not a word.
3440  He found a hole, very low upon a board,
3441  Where the cat was accustomed to creep in,
3442  And through that hole he looked in very carefully,
3443  And at the last he had a sight of him.
3444  This Nicholas sat ever gaping upward,
3445  As if he were gazing on the new moon.
3446  Down he goes, and told his master immediately
3447  In what condition he saw this same man.

3448  This carpenter began to bless himself,
3449  And said, "Help us, Saint Frideswide!
3450  A man knows little what shall happen to him.
3451  This man is fallen, because of his astronomy,
3452  In some madness or in some fit.
3453  I always thought well how it should be!
3454  Men should not know of God's secrets.
3455  Yes, blessed be always an unlearned man
3456  Who knows nothing but only his belief!
3457  So fared another clerk with astronomy;
3458  He walked in the fields to look
3459  Upon the stars, (to find) there what should happen,
3460  Until he was fallen in a fertilizer pit;
3461  He did not see that. But yet, by Saint Thomas,
3462  I feel very sorry for clever Nicholas.
3463  He shall be scolded for his studying,
3464  If that I may, by Jesus, heaven's king!
3465  Get me a staff, that I may pry up from below,
3466  While thou, Robyn, lift up the door.
3467  He shall (come) out of his studying, as I guess."
3468  And to the chamber door he turned his attention.
3469  His servant was a strong fellow for this purpose,
3470  And by the hasp he heaved it off at once;
3471  Onto the floor the door fell straightway.
3472  This Nicholas sat ever as still as stone,
3473  And ever gaped upward into the air.
3474  This carpenter supposed he was in despair,
3475  And seized him by the shoulders vigorously,
3476  And shook him hard, and cried loudly,
3477  "What! Nicholay! What, how! What, look down!
3478  Awake, and think on Christ's passion!
3479  I bless thee from elves and from evil creatures."
3480  Therewith the night-charm he said straightway
3481  On four corners of the house about,
3482  And on the threshold of the door outside:
3483  "Jesus Christ and Saint Benedict,
3484  Bless this house from every wicked creature,
3485  For evil spirits of the nights, the white pater-noster!
3486  Where went thou, Saint Peter's sister?"

3487  And at the last this clever Nicholas
3488  Began to sigh deeply, and said, "Alas!
3489  Shall all the world be lost right now?"

3490  This carpenter answered, "What sayest thou?
3491  What! Think on God, as we do, men who work."
3492  This Nicholas answered, "Fetch me drink,
3493  And after will I speak in private
3494  About a certain matter that concerns me and thee.
3495  I will tell it to no other man, certainly."

3496  This carpenter goes down, and comes again,
3497  And brought of strong ale a large quart;
3498  And when each of them had drunk his part,
3499  This Nicholas shut fast his door,
3500  And the carpenter sat down by him.

3501  He said, "John, my host, beloved and dear,
3502  Thou shalt upon thy pledged word swear to me here
3503  That to no person thou shalt this counsel reveal,
3504  For it is Christ's secrets that I say,
3505  And if thou tell it to anyone, thou art completely lost;
3506  For this vengeance thou shalt have therefore,
3507  That if thou betray me, thou shalt go mad."
3508  "Nay, Christ forbid it, for his holy blood!"
3509  Said then this hapless man, "I am no blabbermouth,
3510  And, though I say it, I do not like to gab.
3511  Say what thou will, I shall never tell it
3512  To child nor wife, by Him that rescued souls from hell!"

3513  "Now John," said Nicholas, "I will not lie;
3514  I have found in my astrology,
3515  As I have looked on the bright moon,
3516  That now on Monday next, after midnight,
3517  Shall fall a rain, and that so wild and raging
3518  That Noah's flood was never half so large.
3519  This world," he said, "in less than an hour
3520  Shall all be drowned, so hideous is the shower.
3521  Thus shall mankind drown, and lose their lives."

3522  This carpenter answered, "Alas, my wife!
3523  And shall she drown? Alas, my Alisoun!"
3524  For sorrow of this he almost fell down,
3525  And said, "Is there no remedy in this case?"

3526  "Why, yes indeed, by God," said clever Nicholas,
3527  "If thou will act in accordance with learning and (good) advice.
3528  Thou mayst not act according to thine own ideas;
3529  For thus says Salomon, which was very true:
3530  `Do all in accordance with good advice, and thou shalt not rue (it).'
3531  And if thou will act in accordance with good advice,
3532  I guarantee, without mast and sail,
3533  Yet shall I save her and thee and me.
3534  Hast thou not heard how Noah was saved,
3535  When our Lord had warned him before
3536  That all the world should be destroyed by water?"

3537  "Yes indeed," said this Carpenter, "very long ago."

3538  "Hast thou not heard," said Nicholas, "also
3539  The sorrow of Noah with his fellowship,
3540  Before he could get his wife onto the ship?
3541  He would rather, I dare well guarantee,
3542  At that time, than have all his black sheep
3543  That she had had a ship for herself alone.
3544  And therefore, knowest thou what is best to do?
3545  This needs haste, and of a hasty thing
3546  Men may not preach nor make tarrying.

3547  "Right now go bring us quickly into this dwelling
3548  A kneading trough, or else a large vat,
3549  For each of us, but see that they be large,
3550  In which we may float as in a barge,
3551  And have therein sufficient victuals
3552  But for a day -- fie on the remnant!
3553  The water shall recede and go away
3554  About nine a.m. on the next day.
3555  But Robin, thy knave, may not know of this,
3556  And also thy maid Gille I can not save;
3557  Ask not why, for though thou ask me,
3558  I will not tell God's secrets.
3559  It suffices thee, unless thy wits go mad,
3560  To have as great a grace as Noah had.
3561  Thy wife shall I well save, beyond doubt.
3562  Go now thy way, and speed thee on this business.

3563  "But when thou hast, for her and thee and me,
3564  Got us these three kneading tubs,
3565  Then shalt thou hang them in the roof very high,
3566  In a way that no man may espy our preparations.
3567  And when thou thus hast done as I have said,
3568  And hast laid our victuals carefully in them,
3569  And also an axe to smite the cord in two,
3570  When the water comes, so that we may go
3571  And break a hole on high, upon the gable,
3572  Toward the garden, over the stable,
3573  That we may freely pass forth on our way,
3574  When the great shower is gone away.
3575  Then shalt thou float as merry, I guarantee,
3576  As does the white duck after her drake.
3577  Then will I call, `How, Alison! How, John!
3578  Be merry, for the flood will soon pass.'
3579  And thou will say, `Hail, master Nicholay!
3580  Good morrow, I see thee well, for it is day.'
3581  And then shall we be lords all our life
3582  Of all the world, like Noah and his wife.

3583  "But of one thing I warn thee very sternly:
3584  Be well advised on that same night
3585  On which we are entered onto shipboard,
3586  That not one of us speak a word,
3587  Nor call, nor cry, but be in his prayer;
3588  For it is God's own dear command.

3589  "Thy wife and thou must hang far apart,
3590  So that between yow shall be no sin,
3591  No more in looking than there shall be in deed.
3592  This ordinance is said. Go, God give thee success!
3593  Tomorrow at night, when people are all asleep,
3594  Into our kneading-tubs will we creep,
3595  And sit there, awaiting God's grace.
3596  Go now thy way; I have no more time
3597  To make of this any longer preaching.
3598  Men say thus, `send the wise, and say nothing.'
3599  Thou art so wise, one needs not teach thee.
3600  Go, save our life, and that I beseech thee."

3601  This hapless carpenter goes forth his way.
3602  Very often he said "Alas and woe is me,"
3603  And to his wife he told his secret,
3604  And she was aware, and knew it better than he,
3605  What all this ingenious scheme meant.
3606  But nonetheless she acted as if she would die,
3607  And said, "Alas! go forth thy way quickly,
3608  Help us to escape, or we are dead each one of us!
3609  I am thy faithful, truly wedded wife;
3610  Go, dear spouse, and help to save our lives."

3611  Lo, what a great thing is emotion!
3612  One can die of imagination,
3613  So deeply may a mental image be taken.
3614  This hapless carpenter begins to tremble;
3615  He thinks truly that he can see
3616  Noah's flood come surging like the sea
3617  To drown Alisoun, his honey dear.
3618  He weeps, wails, looks wretched;
3619  He sighs with very many a sorry groan;
3620  He goes and gets him a kneading trough,
3621  And after that a tub and a large vat,
3622  And secretly he sent them to his dwelling,
3623  And hanged them in the roof secretly.
3624  With his own hand he made three ladders,
3625  To climb by the rungs and the uprights
3626  Unto the tubs hanging in the beams,
3627  And provisioned them, both trough and tub,
3628  With bread, and cheese, and good ale in a jug,
3629  Sufficing just enough for a day.
3630  But before he had made all this preparation,
3631  He sent his servant, and also his servant girl,
3632  Upon his business to go to London.
3633  And on the Monday, when it drew toward night,
3634  He shut his door without candlelight,
3635  And prepared everything as it should be.
3636  And shortly, up they climbed all three;
3637  They sat still a good two and one-half minutes.

3638  "Now, Pater-noster, quiet!" said Nicholay,
3639  And "Quiet!" said John, and "Quiet!" said Alisoun.
3640  This carpenter said his devotion,
3641  And still he sits, and says his prayer,
3642  Awaiting the rain, if he might hear it.

3643  The dead sleep, for weary business,
3644  Fell on this carpenter right, as I guess,
3645  About curfew time, or a little more;
3646  For suffering of his spirit he groans deeply,
3647  And also he snores, for his head lay wrong.
3648  Down on the ladder stalks Nicholay,
3649  And Alisoun very quietly down she sped;
3650  Without more words they go to bed,
3651  Where the carpenter is accustomed to lie.
3652  There was the revel and the sounds of festivity;
3653  And thus lie Alison and Nicholas,
3654  In business of mirth and of pleasure,
3655  Until the bell of the early morning service began to ring,
3656  And friars in the chapel began to sing.

3657  This parish clerk, this amorous Absolon,
3658  That is for love always so woebegone,
3659  Upon the Monday was at Oseneye
3660  With company, to be merry and amuse himself,
3661  And by chance asked a cloistered monk
3662  Very discreetly about John the carpenter;
3663  And he drew him apart out of the church,
3664  And said, "I know not; I have not seen him working here
3665  Since Saturday; I suppose that he is gone
3666  For timber, where our abbot has sent him;
3667  For he is accustomed to go for timber
3668  And dwell at the granary a day or two;
3669  Or else he is at his house, certainly.
3670  Where he may be, I can not truly say."

3671  This Absolon very was jolly and happy,
3672  And thought, "Now is time to stay awake all night,
3673  For surely I saw him not stirring
3674  About his door, since day began to spring.

3675  "As I may prosper, I shall, at cock's crow,
3676  Very quietly knock at his window
3677  That stands very low upon his bedroom's wall.
3678  To Alison now I will tell all
3679  My love-longing, for yet I shall not miss
3680  That at the very least I shall her kiss.
3681  Some sort of comfort shall I have, by my faith.
3682  My mouth has itched all this long day;
3683  That is a sign of kissing at the least.
3684  All night I dreamed also I was at a feast.
3685  Therefore I will go sleep an hour or two,
3686  And all the night then will I stay awake and play."

3687  When the first cock has crowed (about midnight), at once
3688  Up rises this elegant lover Absolon,
3689  And dresses himself handsomely, in every detail.
3690  But first he chews cardamom and licorice,
3691  To smell sweet, ere he had combed his hair.
3692  Under his tongue he had a true-love herb,
3693  For thus he thought he would be gracious.
3694  He goes to the carpenter's house,
3695  And he stands still under the casement window --
3696  Unto his breast it reached, it was so low --
3697  And softly he coughs with a gentle sound:
3698  "What do you, honey-comb, sweet Alisoun,
3699  My fair bird, my sweet cinnamon?
3700  Awake, sweetheart mine, and speak to me!
3701  Well little you think upon my woe,
3702  That for your love I sweat wherever I go.
3703  No wonder is though that I swelter and sweat;
3704  I mourn as does a lamb after the tit.
3705  Indeed, sweetheart, I have such love-longing
3706  That like a true turtledove is my mourning.
3707  I can eat no more than a maiden."

3708  "Go from the window, you idiot," she said;
3709  "So help me God, it will not be `come kiss me.'
3710  I love another -- and else I were to blame --
3711  Well better than thee, by Jesus, Absolon.
3712  Go forth thy way, or I will cast a stone,
3713  And let me sleep, in the name of twenty devils!"
3714  "Alas," said Absolon, "and woe is me,
3715  That true love was ever in such miserable circumstances!
3716  Then kiss me, since it can be no better,
3717  For Jesus' love, and for the love of me."

3718  "Wilt thou then go thy way with that?" said she.

3719  "Yes, certainly, sweetheart," said this Absolon.

3720  "Then make thee ready," said she, "I come right now."
3721  And unto Nicholas she said quietly,
3722  "Now hush, and thou shalt laugh all thy fill."

3723  This Absolon set himself down on his knees
3724  And said, "I am a lord in every way;
3725  For after this I hope there comes more.
3726  Sweetheart, thy grace, and sweet bird, thy mercy!"

3727  The window she undoes, and that in haste.
3728  "Get done with it," said she, "come on, and hurry up,
3729  Lest our neighbors espy thee."

3730  This Absolon wiped his mouth very dry.
3731  Dark was the night as pitch, or as the coal,
3732  And at the window out she put her hole,
3733  And Absolon, to him it happened no better nor worse,
3734  But with his mouth he kissed her naked ass
3735  With great relish, before he was aware of this.
3736  Back he jumped, and thought it was amiss,
3737  For well he knew a woman has no beard.
3738  He felt a thing all rough and long haired,
3739  And said, "Fie! alas! what have I done?"

3740  "Tehee!" said she, and clapped the window to,
3741  And Absolon goes forth walking sadly.

3742  "A beard! A beard!" said clever Nicholas,
3743  "By God's body, this goes fair and well."

3744  This hapless Absolon heard every bit,
3745  And on his lip he began for anger to bite,
3746  And to himself he said, "I shall pay thee back."

3747  Who rubs now, who now scrubs his lips
3748  With dust, with sand, with straw, with cloth, with chips,
3749  But Absolon, who says very often, "Alas!"
3750  "My soul I entrust to Satan,
3751  If I would not rather than (have) all this town," said he,
3752  "Be avenged for this insult.
3753  Alas," said he, "alas, I did not turn away!"
3754  His hot love was cold and all extinguished;
3755  For from that time that he had kissed her ass,
3756  Love-making he thought not worth not a watercress,
3757  For he was healed of his malady.
3758  Very often he did renounce love-making,
3759  And wept as does a child that is beaten.
3760  At a slow pace he went down the street
3761  To a smith men called dan Gerveys,
3762  Who in his forge made plowing equipment;
3763  He sharpens ploughshares and plough blades busily.
3764  This Absolon knocked all gently,
3765  And said, "Open up, Gerveys, and that right now."

3766  "What, who art thou?" "It am I, Absolon."
3767  "What, Absolon! for Christ's sweet cross,
3768  Why rise you so early? Ay, bless me!
3769  What ails yow? Some pretty girl, God knows it,
3770  Hath brought you to be running around like this.
3771  By Saint Note, you know well what I mean."

3772  This Absolon cared not a bean
3773  For all his joking; no word he gave in reply;
3774  He had more business on hand
3775  Than Gerveys knew, and said, "Friend so dear,
3776  That hot plough blade in the hearth here,
3777  Lend it to me; I have something to do with it,
3778  And I will bring it back to thee very soon."

3779  Gerveys answered, "Certainly, were it gold,
3780  Or in a sack countless silver coins,
3781  Thou sholdest have it, as I am true smith.
3782  Ay, Christ's foe! What will you do with it?"

3783  "Concerning that," said Absolon, "be as be may.
3784  I shall well tell it to thee to-morrow" --
3785  And caught the plough blade by the cold handle.
3786  Very softly out at the door he began to steal,
3787  And went unto the carpenter's wall.
3788  He coughs first, and knocks then
3789  Upon the window, just as he did before.



3790  This Alison answered, "Who is there
3791  That knocks so? I swear it is a thief."

3792  "Why, nay," said he, "God knows, my sweet beloved,
3793  I am thy Absolon, my darling.
3794  Of gold," said he, "I have brought thee a ring.
3795  My mother gave it to me, as God may save me;
3796  Very fine it is, and also nicely engraved.
3797  This will I give thee, if thou kiss me."

3798  This Nicholas was risen to piss,
3799  And thought he would make the joke even better;
3800  He should kiss his ass before he escapes.
3801  And he opened up the window hastily,
3802  And he puts out his ass stealthily
3803  Over the buttock, to the thigh;
3804  And then spoke this clerk, this Absolon,
3805  "Speak, sweet bird, I know not where thou art."

3806  This Nicholas immediately let fly a fart
3807  As great as if it had been a thunder-bolt,
3808  So that with the stroke he was almost blinded;
3809  And he was ready with his hot iron,
3810  And he smote Nicholas in the middle of the ass.

3811  Off goes the skin a hand's breadth about,
3812  The hot plough blade so burned his rump
3813  And for the pain he thought he would die.
3814  As if he were crazy, for woe he began to cry,
3815  "Help! Water! Water! Help, for God's heart!"

3816  This carpenter woke suddenly out of his slumber,
3817  And heard someone cry "water!" as if he were crazy,
3818  And thought, "Alas, now comes Nowell's flood!"
3819  He sits up without more words,
3820  And with his ax he smote the cord in two,
3821  And down goes all; he found nothing to sell (wasted no time),
3822  Neither bread nor ale, until he came to the pavement
3823  Upon the floor, and there he lay in a swoon.

3824  Up started Alison and Nicholay,
3825  And cried "Out" and "Help" in the street.
3826  The neighbors, both low-ranking and high,
3827  Run in to gawk at this man,
3828  Who yet lay in a swoon, both pale and wan,
3829  For with the fall he had broken his arm.
3830  But he had to stand up for himself, though it went badly;
3831  For when he spoke, he was immediately put down
3832  By clever Nicholas and Alisoun.
3833  They told every one that he was crazy;
3834  He was so afraid of Nowell's flood
3835  Because of his imagination that in his foolishness
3836  He had bought himself three kneading tubs,
3837  And had hanged them in the roof above;
3838  And that he begged them, for God's love,
3839  To sit in the roof, to keep him company.

3840  The folk did laugh at his foolishness;
3841  Into the roof they stare and they gape,
3842  And turned all his harm into a joke.
3843  For whatever this carpenter answered,
3844  It was for naught; no one listened to his explanation,
3845  With oaths great he was so sworn down
3846  That he was considered crazy in all the town;
3847  For every clerk immediately agreed with the other.
3848  They said, "The man is crazy, my dear brother";
3849  And every person did laugh at this strife.
3850  Thus screwed was this carpenter's wife,
3851  In spite of all his guarding and his jealousy,
3852  And Absolon has kissed her lower eye,
3853  And Nicholas is scalded in the rump.
3854  This tale is done, and God save all this company!

Heere endeth the Millere his Tale
[Here ends the Miller's Tale]
