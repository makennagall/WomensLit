3855  When folk had laughed at this foolish business
3856  Of Absolon and clever Nicholas,
3857  Different folk said different opinions,
3858  But for the most part they laughed and enjoyed themselves.
3859  And at this tale I saw no man aggrieved,
3860  Except for only Osewold the Reeve.
3861  Because he was of the carpenter's craft,
3862  A little anger is left in his heart;
3863  He began to grouch, and criticized it a little.

3864  "As I may prosper," said he, "very well could I repay thee
3865  With (a tale of the) blearing of a proud miller's eye (tricking him),
3866  If I wanted to speak of ribaldry.
3867  But I am old; because of age I do not want to play;
3868  Grass time is done; my fodder is now dry straw;
3869  This white head reveals my old years;
3870  My heart is as moldy as my hairs,

3871  Unless I fare as does the fruit of the medlar --
3872  That same fruit continually grows worse,
3873  Until it is rotten in rubbish or in straw.
3874  We old men, I fear, fare like that:
3875  Until we are rotten, we can not be ripe;
3876  We dance always while the world will pipe.
3877  For in our will there sticks ever a nail,
3878  To have a white head and a green tail,
3879  As a leek has; for though our power is gone,
3880  Our will desires folly continually.
3881  For when we can not do anything, then will we talk about it;
3882  Yet in our old ashes fire is raked over (covered).

3883  "Four live coals have we, which I shall describe --
3884  Boasting, lying, anger, greed;
3885  These four little sparks belong to old age.
3886  Our old limbs may well be feeble,
3887  But desire shall not be lacking, that is truth.
3888  And yet I have always a young man's desires,
3889  As many years as have passed hence
3890  Since my tap of life began to run.
3891  For surely, when I was born, immediately
3892  Death turned on the spigot of life and let it flow,
3893  And ever since the tap has so run
3894  Until the barrel is almost all empty.
3895  The stream of life now drops on the rim.
3896  The foolish tongue may well ring and chime
3897  About wretchedness that passed long ago;
3898  With old folk, save dotage, there is no more!"

3899  When our Host had heard this sermon making,
3900  He began to speak as lordly as a king.
3901  He said, "What amounts all this wit?
3902  What! shall we speak all day of holy writ?
3903  The devil made a reeve to preach,
3904  Or of a cobbler made a shipman or a physician.
3905  Say forth thy tale, and do not waste the time.
3906  Lo Deptford, and it is almost seven thirty!
3907  Lo Greenwich, in which is many a rascal!
3908  It is well time to begin thy tale."

3909  "Now, sires," said this Osewold the Reeve,
3910  "I pray yow all that you not be displeased,
3911  Though I answer (him), and somewhat make a fool of him;
3912  For it is permissable to repel force with force.

3913  "This drunk Miller has told us here
3914  How a carpenter was tricked,
3915  Perhaps in scorn, for I am one.
3916  And, by your leave, I shall repay him right now;
3917  Right in his churl's terms will I speak.
3918  I pray to God his neck may break into pieces;
3919  He can well in my eye see a piece of straw,
3920  But in his own he can not see a large piece of timber."

The Reeve's Tale

Heere bigynneth the Reves Tale.

3921  At Trumpington, not far from Cambridge,
3922  There goes a brook, and over that a bridge,
3923  Upon the which brook there stands a mill;
3924  And this is absolute truth that I tell you:
3925  A miller was there dwelling many a day.
3926  As any peacock he was proud and gay.
3927  He could play the bagpipe and fish, and mend nets,
3928  And play a drinking game, and well wrestle and shoot;
3929  Always by his belt he carried a long cutlass,
3930  And very sharp was the blade of the sword.
3931  An elegant dagger he carried in his pouch;
3932  There was no man, for peril, dared touch him.
3933  A Sheffield knife he carried in his hose.
3934  Round was his face, and he had a pug nose;
3935  As bald as an ape was his skull.
3936  He was a quarrelsome bully in every way.
3937  There dared no person lay hand upon him,
3938  That he did not swear he should pay for it right away.
3939  A thief he was, in truth, of grain and meal,
3940  And that a sly one, and accustomed to steal.
3941  His name was called haughty Symkyn.
3942  A wife he had, come of noble kin;
3943  The parson of the town was her father.
3944  With her he gave very many a pan of brass,
3945  So that Symkyn should be allied with his family.
3946  She was fostered in a nunnery;
3947  For Symkyn would have no wife, as he said,
3948  Unless she were well educated and a virgin,
3949  To preserve his state of yeomanry.
3950  And she was proud, and brazen as is a magpie.
3951  A very fair sight was it to look upon those two;
3952  On holidays before her would he go
3953  With the tip of his hood wound about his head,
3954  And she came after in a gown of red;
3955  And Symkyn had hose of the same color.
3956  There dared no one call her anything but "lady";
3957  There was no one so brave that went by the way
3958  That dared flirt with her or once play,
3959  Unless he wished to be slain by Symkyn
3960  With cutlass, or with knife, or dagger.
3961  For jealous folk are dangerous always --
3962  At least they would like their wives to think so.
3963  And also, because she was a bit besmirched (by her illegitimacy),
3964  She was as haughty as water in a ditch,
3965  And full of disdain and of scorn.
3966  She thought that a lady should be aloof,
3967  Considering her family and her education
3968  Which she had learned in the nunnery.

3969  A daughter had they between them two
3970  Of twenty years of age, without any more,
3971  Except for a child that was a half year of age;
3972  In cradle it lay and was a good looking little boy.
3973  This wench was thick and well grown,
3974  With pug nose and eyes gray as glass,
3975  With buttocks broad and breasts round and high.
3976  But right fair was her hair; I will not lie.

3977  This parson of the town, because she was fair,
3978  Was determined to make her his heir,
3979  Both of his property and his household,
3980  And he raised difficulties about her marriage.
3981  His purpose was to bestow her high
3982  Into some worthy family of noble ancestry;
3983  For holy church's goods must be dispensed
3984  To holy church's blood, which is descended from the church.
3985  Therefore he would his holy blood honor,
3986  Though he holy church should devour.

3987  A profitable monopoly on milling has this miller, out of doubt,
3988  With wheat and malt of all the land about;
3989  And namely there was an important college
3990  People call the Soler Hall at Cambridge;
3991  There their wheat and also their malt was ground.
3992  And on one day it happened, at a time,
3993  The manciple lay sick with a malady;
3994  People thought indeed that he should die.
3995  For which this miller stole both meal and grain
3996  A hundred times more than before;
3997  For before this he stole but courteously,
3998  But now he was a thief excessively,
3999  For which the warden (of the college) complained and made a fuss.
4000  But the miller thought that not worth a weed;
4001  He blustered fiercely, and swore it was not so.

4002  Then were there two young poor scholars,
4003  Who dwelt in this hall, of which I tell.
4004  Headstrong they were, and eager for sport,
4005  And, only for their mirth and amusement,
4006  Upon the warden busily they implore
4007  To give them leave, for but a little while,
4008  To go to the mill and see their grain ground;
4009  And boldly they dared pledge their necks
4010  The miller should not steal from them half a peck
4011  Of grain by trickery, nor rob them by force;
4012  And at the last the warden gave hem leave.
4013  John was called that one, and Aleyn was called that other;
4014  Of one town were they born, that was called Strother,
4015  Far in the north; I can not tell where.

4016  This Aleyn makes ready all his gear,
4017  And on a horse the sack he cast immediately.
4018  Forth goes Aleyn the clerk, and also John,
4019  With good sword and with buckler by their sides.
4020  John knew the way -- they needed no guide --
4021  And at the mill he lays the sack down.
4022  Aleyn spoke first: "All hail, Symond, in faith!
4023  How fares thy faire daughter and thy wife?"

4024  "Aleyn, welcome," said Symkyn, "by my life!
4025  And John also, how now, what do you here?"

4026  "Symond," said John, "by God, need knows no law.
4027  He who has no servant must serve himself,
4028  Or else he is a fool, as clerks say.
4029  Our manciple, I expect he will be dead,
4030  So continually ache the teeth in his head;
4031  And therefore I am come, and also Alayn,
4032  To grind our grain and carry it home again;
4033  I pray you speed us hence as fast as you can."

4034  "It shall be done," said Symkyn, "by my faith!
4035  What will you do while it is being done?"

4036  "By God, right by the hopper will I stand,"
4037  Said John, "and see how the grain goes in.
4038  Yet saw I never, by my father's kin,
4039  How the hopper wags to and fro."

4040  Aleyn answered, "John, and wilt thou do so?
4041  Then will I be beneath, by my head,
4042  And see how the meal falls down
4043  Into the trough; that shall be my sport.
4044  For John, in faith, I may be like you;
4045  I am as poor a miller as you are."

4046  This miller smiled at their foolishness,
4047  And thought, "All this is done only for a trick.
4048  They think that no man can trick them,
4049  But by my welfare, yet shall I blear their eyes (fool them),
4050  Despite all the trickery in their philosophy.
4051  The more ingenious tricks that they make,
4052  The more will I steal when I take.
4053  Instead of flour yet will I give them bran.
4054  `The greatest clerks are not the wisest men,'
4055  As once to the wolf thus spoke the mare.
4056  All their learning I reckon not worth a weed."

4057  Out at the door he goes full stealthily,
4058  When he saw his time, quietly.
4059  He looks up and down until he has found
4060  The clerks' horse, where it stood tied
4061  Behind the mill, under an arbor;
4062  And to the horse he goes gently;
4063  He strips off the bridle right away.
4064  And when the horse was loose, he begins to go
4065  Toward the fen, where wild mares run,
4066  And forth with "wehee," through thick and through thin.

4067  This miller goes back to the mill, no word he said,
4068  But does his work, and with the clerks amused himself
4069  Until their grain was completely ground.
4070  And when the meal is sacked and tied,
4071  This John goes out and finds his horse gone away,
4072  And began to cry "Help!" and "Wellaway!
4073  Our horse is lost, Alayn, for God's bones,
4074  Step on thy feet! Come on, man, quickly!
4075  Alas, our warden has lost his saddle horse."
4076  This Aleyn forgot everything, both meal and grain;
4077  All his skillful management was out of his mind.
4078  "What, which way is he gone?" he began to cry.

4079  The wife cam leaping inward at a run.
4080  She said, "Alas! your horse goes to the fen
4081  With wild mares, as fast as he can go.
4082  Curses come on his hand that tied him so carelessly,
4083  And he that should have tied the rein better!"

4084  "Alas," said John, "Aleyn, for Christ's pain
4085  Lay down thy sword, and I will mine also.
4086  I am full strong (swift), God knows, as is a roe deer;
4087  By God's heart, he shall not escape us both!
4088  Why did thou not put the horse in the barn?
4089  Bad luck! By God, Alayn, thou art a fool!"

4090  These hapless clerks have run very fast
4091  Toward the fen, both Aleyn and also John.

4092  And when the miller saw that they were gone,
4093  He half a bushel of their flour has taken,
4094  And ordered his wife to go knead it in a cake.
4095  He said, "I suppose the clerks were leery (of what I might do).
4096  Yet can a miller make a clerk's beard (trick a clerk),
4097  Despite all his learning; now let them go their way!
4098  Lo, there he goes! Yes, let the children play.
4099  They will not catch him easily, by my crown."

4100  These hapless clerks run up and down
4101  With "Stop! Stop! Stand! Stand! Down there, watch out behind,
4102  Go whistle thou, and I shall catch him here!"
4103  But shortly, until that it was truly night,
4104  They could not, though they did al their might,
4105  Catch their horse, he ran always so fast,
4106  Until in a ditch they caught him at the last.

4107  Weary and wet, as a beast is in the rain,
4108  Comes hapless John, and with him comes Aleyn.
4109  "Alas," said John, "the day that I was born!
4110  Now are we driven to contempt and to scorn.
4111  Our grain is stolen; men will call us fools,
4112  Both the warden and all our fellows,
4113  And namely the miller, wellaway!"

4114  Thus laments John as he goes by the way
4115  Toward the mill, and the horse Bayard in his hand.
4116  The miller sitting by the fire he found,
4117  For it was night, and further they could not go;
4118  But for the love of God they ask him
4119  For lodging and for refreshment, for their cash.

4120  The miller said in reply, "If there be any,
4121  Such as it is, yet shall you have your share.
4122  My house is small, but you have learned the art of logic;
4123  You know how by logical arguments to make a place
4124  A mile broad out of twenty feet of space.
4125  Let's see now if this place may suffice,
4126  Or make it large by speech, as is your custom."

4127  "Now, Symond," said John, "by Saint Cuthbert,
4128  Thou art always joking, and this is nicely answered.
4129  I have heard said, `Man shall take one of two things:
4130  Such as he finds, or take such as he brings.'
4131  But specially I pray thee, host dear,
4132  Get us some food and drink, and make us good cheer,
4133  And we will pay truly at the full.
4134  With empty hand men may lure no hawks;
4135  Lo, here is our silver, ready to spend."

4136  This miller into town his daughter sent
4137  For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose,
4138  And tied up their horse, it should no more go loose,
4139  And in his own bedroom made them a bed,
4140  With sheets and with blankets nicely spread
4141  Not ten feet or twelve from his own bed.
4142  His daughter had a bed, all by herself,
4143  Right in the same chamber side by side.
4144  It could be no better, and (do you know) the cause why?
4145  There was no larger lodging in the place.
4146  They sup and they converse, to entertain themselves,
4147  And drink ever strong ale of the best quality.
4148  About midnight they went to bed.

4149  Well has this miller varnished his head (drank heavily);
4150  Full pale he was for drunkenness, and not red.
4151  He belches, and he speaks through the nose
4152  As if he had hoarseness, or had a cold.
4153  To bed he goes, and with him goes his wife.
4154  She was as cheerful and jolly as any jay,
4155  So was her jolly whistle well wetted.
4156  The cradle at her bed's feet is set,
4157  To rock, and to give the child to suck.
4158  And when all that was in the crock was drunk,
4159  To bed went the daughter right away;
4160  To bed goes Aleyn and also John;
4161  There was no more -- they needed no sleeping potion.
4162  This miller has imbibed so much ale
4163  That he snorts like a horse in his sleep,
4164  And of his tail behind he took no heed.
4165  His wife bore him a bass accompaniment, very loud;
4166  One could hear their snoring two furlongs away;
4167  The wench snores also, to keep them company.

4168  Aleyn the clerk, who heard this melody,
4169  He poked John, and said, "Sleepest thou?
4170  Heardest thou ever such a song before now?
4171  Lo, such a compline (evening service) is made by them all;
4172  May a wild fire upon their bodies fall!
4173  Who heard ever such an amazing thing?
4174  Yes, they shall have the best (i.e., the worst) of a bad ending.
4175  This long night there comes to me no sleep;
4176  But yet, no matter, all shall be for the best.
4177  For, John," said he, "as ever I may thrive,
4178  If I can, yon wench will I screw.
4179  Some redress the law has shaped for us,
4180  For, John, there is a law that says thus:
4181  That if a man in one point is injured,
4182  That in another he shall be relieved.
4183  Our grain is stolen, truly, it can not be denied,
4184  And we have had a hard time all this day;
4185  And since I shall have no recompense
4186  For my loss, I will have satisfaction.
4187  By God's soul, it shall be no other way!"

4188  This John answered, "Alayn, be careful!
4189  The miller is a perilous man," he said,
4190  "And if he out of his sleep suddenly awoke,
4191  He might do injury to us both."

4192  Aleyn answered, "I reckon him not worth a fly."
4193  And up he rises, and by the wench he crept.
4194  This wench lay on her back and fast slept,
4195  Until he was so near, before she could see him,
4196  It was too late to cry out,
4197  And shortly to speak, they were together.
4198  Now play, Aleyn, for I will speak of John.

4199  This John lies still five minutes or so,
4200  And to himself he laments and feels sorry.
4201  "Alas!" said he, "this is a wicked trick;
4202  Now may I say that I am nothing but a fool.
4203  Yet has my fellow something for his harm;
4204  He has the miller's daughter in his arm.
4205  He took a risk, and has accomplished his purpose,
4206  And I lie like a sack of rubbish in my bed;
4207  And when this trick is told another day,
4208  I shall be considered a fool, a weakling!
4209  I will arise and chance it, by my faith!
4210  `The timid one is unlucky,' thus people say."
4211  And up he rose, and quietly he went
4212  To the cradle, and in his hand seized it,
4213  And carried it quietly to the foot of his bed.

4214  Soon after this the wife stopped her snoring,
4215  And awoke, and went out to piss,
4216  And came back, and began to miss her cradle,
4217  And groped here and there, but she found none.
4218  "Alas!" said she, "I had almost gone wrong;
4219  I had almost gone to the clerks' bed.
4220  Ay, bless me! Then I would have made a mess of it!"
4221  And forth she goes until she found the cradle.
4222  She gropes always further with her hand,
4223  And found the bed, and thought all was well,
4224  Because the cradle by it stood,
4225  And did not know where she was, for it was dark;
4226  But gently she crept in to the clerk,
4227  And lies full still, and would have gone to sleep.
4228  Within a moment this John the clerk leaped up,
4229  And on this good wife he lays on vigorously.
4230  She had not had so merry an experience for a long time;
4231  He stabs hard and deep as if he were mad.
4232  This jolly life have these two clerks led
4233  Until the third cock began to sing (an hour before dawn).

4234  Aleyn grew weary at the time of dawn,
4235  For he had labored all the long night,
4236  And said, "Farewell, Malyne, sweet creature!
4237  The day is come; I may no longer remain here;
4238  But evermore, wherever I walk or ride,
4239  I am thine own clerk, as I may prosper!"

4240  "Now, dear sweetheart," said she, "go, farewell!
4241  But before thou go, one thing I will tell thee:
4242  When thou go homeward by the mill,
4243  Right at the entry behind the door
4244  Thou shalt find a cake of half a bushel
4245  That was made of thine own meal,
4246  Which I helped my father to steal.
4247  And, good sweetheart, God save and keep thee!"
4248  And with that word she almost began to weep.

4249  Aleyn up rises, and thought, "Before it dawns,
4250  I will go creep in by my fellow,"
4251  And found the cradle with his hand right away.
4252  "By God," thought he, "I have gone all wrong.
4253  My head is dizzy from my work to-night,
4254  That makes me go not right.
4255  I know well by the cradle I have gone wrong;
4256  Here lies the miller and his wife also."
4257  And forth he goes, in the name of twenty devils,
4258  Unto the bed where the miller lay.
4259  He expected to have crept in by his fellow John,
4260  And in by the miller he crept right then,
4261  And caught him by the neck, and quietly he spoke.
4262  He said, "Thou John, thou pig's-head, awake,
4263  For Christ's soul, and hear a real joke.
4264  For by that lord that is called Saint James,
4265  I have three times in this short night
4266  Screwed the miller's daughter flat on her back,
4267  While thou hast, like a coward, been terrified."

4268  "Yes, false scoundrel," said the miller, "hast (thou done so)?
4269  Ah, false traitor! False clerk!" said he,
4270  "Thou shalt be dead, by God's worthiness!
4271  Who dared be so bold to degrade
4272  My daughter, who is come from such noble lineage?"
4273  And by the Adam's apple he caught Alayn,
4274  And he seized him angrily in turn,
4275  And on the nose he smote him with his fist.
4276  Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast;
4277  And on the floor, with nose and mouth badly broken,
4278  They wallow as do two pigs in a bag;
4279  And up they go, and down again straightway,
4280  Until the miller stumbled on a stone,
4281  And down he fell backward upon his wife,
4282  Who knew nothing of this foolish strife;
4283  For she was fallen asleep a little bit
4284  With John the clerk, who had been awake all night,
4285  And with the fall out of her sleep she started up.
4286  "Help! holy cross of Bromeholm," she said,
4287  "In your hands! Lord, to Thee I call!
4288  Awake, Symond! The fiend has fallen on me.
4289  My heart is broken; help! I am as good as dead!
4290  There lies one upon my belly and one on my head.
4291  Help, Symkyn, for the false clerks fight!"

4292  This John started up as fast as ever he could,
4293  And grasps by the walls to and fro,
4294  To find a staff; and she leaped up also,
4295  And knew the interior of the house better than did this John,
4296  And by the wall a staff she found right away,
4297  And saw a little glimmering of a light,
4298  For at a hole in shone the moon bright,
4299  And by that light she saw both the two of them,
4300  But surely she did not know who was who,
4301  But she saw a white thing in her eye.
4302  And when she did espy this white thing,
4303  She thought the clerk had worn a night cap,
4304  And with the staff she drew ever nearer and nearer,
4305  And intended to have hit this Aleyn squarely,
4306  And smote the miller on the bald skull,
4307  So that down he goes, and cried, "Help! I die!"
4308  These clerks beat him well and let him lie,
4309  And dress themselves, and took their horse straightway,
4310  And also their meal, and on their way they go.
4311  And at the mill yet they took their cake
4312  Of half a bushel flour, very well baked.

4313  Thus is the proud miller well beaten,
4314  And has lost the charge for grinding of the wheat,
4315  And paid for the supper every bit
4316  Of Aleyn and of John, who beat him well.
4317  His wife is screwed, and his daughter also.
4318  Lo, this is how it is when a miller is false!
4319  And therefore this proverb is said very truly,
4320  "One who does evil should not expect good."
4321  A trickster shall himself be tricked.
4322  And God, that sits high in majesty,
4323  Save al this company, high ranking and low (every one)!
4324  Thus have I repaid the Miller in my tale.



Heere is ended the Reves Tale
