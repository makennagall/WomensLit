"Experience, though noon auctoritee
"Experience, though no written authority
2  Were in this world, is good enough for me
3  To speak of the woe that is in marriage;
4  For, gentlemen, since I was twelve years of age,
5  Thanked be God who is eternally alive,
6  I have had five husbands at the church door --
7  If I so often might have been wedded --
8  And all were worthy men in their way.
9  But to me it was told, certainly, it is not long ago,
10  That since Christ went never but once
11  To a wedding, in the Cana of Galilee,
12  That by that same example he taught me
13  That I should be wedded but once.
14  Listen also, lo, what a sharp word for this purpose,
15  Beside a well, Jesus, God and man,
16  Spoke in reproof of the Samaritan:
17  `Thou hast had five husbands,' he said,
18  `And that same man that now has thee
19  Is not thy husband,' thus he said certainly.
20  What he meant by this, I can not say;
21  But I ask, why the fifth man
22  Was no husband to the Samaritan?
23  How many might she have in marriage?
24  I never yet heard tell in my lifetime
25  A definition of this number.
26  Men may conjecture and interpret in every way,
27  But well I know, expressly, without lie,
28  God commanded us to grow fruitful and multiply;
29  That gentle text I can well understand.
30  Also I know well, he said my husband
31  Should leave father and mother and take to me.
32  But he made no mention of number,
33  Of marrying two, or of marrying eight;
34  Why should men then speak evil of it?

35  Lo, (consider) here the wise king, dan Salomon;
36  I believe he had wives more than one.
37  As would God it were lawful unto me
38  To be refreshed half so often as he!
39  What a gift of God he had because of all his wives!
40  No man that in this world is alive has such (a gift).
41  God knows, this noble king, according to my judgment,
42  The first night had many a merry fit
43  With each of them, so well things went for him in his lifetime.
44  Blessed be God that I have wedded five!
44  [Of which I have picked out the best,
44  Both of their lower purse (scrotum) and of their strongbox.
44  Differing schools make perfect clerks,
44  And differing practice in many various works
44  Makes the workman truly perfect;
44  Of five husbands' schooling am I.]
45  Welcome the sixth, whenever he shall appear.
46  For truly, I will not keep myself chaste in everything.
47  When my husband is gone from the world,
48  Some Christian man shall wed me straightway,
49  For then the apostle says that I am free
50  To wed, by God's side (I swear), wherever it pleases me.
51  He says that to be wedded is no sin;
52  It is better to be wedded than to burn.
53  What do I care, though folk speak evil
54  Of cursed Lamech and his bigamy?
55  I know well Abraham was a holy man,
56  And Jacob also, insofar as I know;
57  And each of them had more than two wives,
58  And many another holy man also.
59  Where can you find, in any historical period,
60  That high God forbad marriage
61  By express word? I pray you, tell me.
62  Or where commanded he virginity?
63  I know as well as you, it is no doubt,
64  The apostle, when he speaks of maidenhood,
65  He said that he had no precept concerning it.
66  Men may advise a woman to be one,
67  But advice is no commandment.
68  He left it to our own judgment;
69  For had God commanded maidenhood,
70  Then had he damned marriage along with the act (of procreation).
71  And certainly, if there were no seed sown,
72  Then from what should virginity grow?
73  In any case, Paul dared not command
74  A thing of which his master gave no command.
75  The prize is set up for virginity;
76  Catch it whoever can, let's see who runs best.

77  But this word does not apply to every person,
78  But where God desires to give it by his power.
79  I know well that the apostle was a virgin;
80  But nonetheless, though he wrote and said
81  He would that every person were such as he,
82  All is nothing but advice to (adopt) virginity.
83  And he gave me leave to be a wife
84  By explicit permission; so it is not blameful
85  To wed me, if my mate should die,
86  Without objection on the grounds of bigamy.
87  Although it would be good to touch no woman --
88  He meant in his bed or in his couch,
89  For it is perilous to assemble both fire and flax;
90  You know what this example may apply to.
91  This is the sum of it: he held virginity
92  More perfect than wedding in weakness.
93  Weakness I call it, unless he and she
94  Would lead all their life in chastity.

95  I grant it well; I have no envy,
96  Though maidenhood may have precedence over a second marriage.
97  It pleases them to be clean, body and spirit;
98  Of my state I will make no boast,
99  For well you know, a lord in his household,
100  He has not every utensil all of gold;
101  Some are of wood, and do their lord service.
102  God calls folk to him in various ways,
103  And each one has of God an individual gift --
104  Some this, some that, as it pleases Him to provide.

105  Virginity is great perfection,
106  And continence also with devotion,
107  But Christ, who is the source of perfection,
108  Did not command that every one should go sell
109  All that he had, and give it to the poor,
110  And in such wise follow him and his footsteps.
111  He spoke to those who would live perfectly;
112  And gentlemen, by your leave, I am not that.
113  I will bestow the flower of all my age
114  In the acts and in fruit of marriage.

115  Tell me also, to what purpose
116  Were members of generation made,
117  And by so perfectly wise a Workman wrought?
118  Trust right well, they were not made for nothing.
119  Interpret whoever will, and say both up and down
120  That they were made for purgation
121  Of urine, and both our small things
122  Were also to know a female from a male,
123  And for no other cause -- do you say no?
124  The experience knows well it is not so.
125  Provided that the clerks be not angry with me,
126  I say this: that they are made for both;
127  That is to say, for urination and for ease
128  Of procreation, in which we do not displease God.
129  Why else should men set in their books
130  That man shall pay to his wife her debt?
131  Now with what should he make his payment,
132  If he did not use his blessed instrument?
133  Then were they made upon a creature
134  To purge urine, and also for procreation.

135  But I say not that every person is required,
136  That has such equipment as I to you told,
137  To go and use them in procreation.
138  Then should men have no regard for chastity.
139  Christ was a virgin and shaped like a man,
140  And many a saint, since the world began;
141  Yet lived they ever in perfect chastity.
142  I will envy no virginity.
143  Let them be bread of pure wheat-seed,
144  And let us wives be called barley-bread;
145  And yet with barley-bread, Mark can tell it,
146  Our Lord Jesus refreshed many a man.
147  In such estate as God has called us
148  I will persevere; I am not fussy.
149  In wifehood I will use my instrument
150  As freely as my Maker has it sent.
151  If I be niggardly, God give me sorrow!
152  My husband shall have it both evenings and mornings,
153  When it pleases him to come forth and pay his debt.
154  A husband I will have -- I will not desist --
155  Who shall be both my debtor and my slave,
156  And have his suffering also
157  Upon his flesh, while I am his wife.
158  I have the power during all my life
159  Over his own body, and not he.
160  Right thus the Apostle told it unto me,
161  And commanded our husbands to love us well.
162  All this sentence pleases me every bit" --

163  Up sprang the Pardoner, and that at once;
164  "Now, madam," he said, "by God and by Saint John!
165  You are a noble preacher in this case.
166  I was about to wed a wife; alas!
167  Why should I pay for it so dearly on my flesh?
168  Yet would I rather wed no wife this year!"

169  "Wait!" she said, "my tale is not begun.
170  Nay, thou shalt drink from another barrel,
171  Before I go, which shall taste worse than ale.
172  And when I have told thee forth my tale
173  Of suffering in marriage,
174  Of which I am expert in all my life --
175  This is to say, myself have been the whip --
176  Than may thou choose whether thou will sip
177  Of that same barrel that I shall open.
178  Beware of it, before thou too near approach;
179  For I shall tell examples more than ten.
180  `Whoever will not be warned by (the examples of) other men,
181  Shall be an example by which other men shall be corrected.'
182  The same words writes Ptholomy;
183  Read in his Almagest, and take it there."

184  "Madam, I would pray you, if it were your will,"
185  Said this Pardoner, "as you began,
186  Tell forth your tale, refrain for no man,
187  And teach us young men of your practice."

188  "Gladly," she said, "since it may please you;
189  But yet I pray to all this company,
190  If I speak according to my fancy,
191  Do not be annoyed by what I say,
192  For my intention is only to amuse.

193  Now, sir, now will I tell forth my tale.
194  As ever may I drink wine or ale,
195  I shall speak the truth; those husbands that I had,
196  Three of them were good, and two were bad.
197  The three were good men, and rich, and old;
198  Hardly might they the statute hold (pay the debt)
199  In which they were bound unto me.
200  You know well what I mean of this, by God!
201  So help me God, I laugh when I think
202  How pitifully at night I made them work!
203  And, by my faith, I set no store by it.
204  They had given me their land and their treasure;
205  I needed not work hard any longer
206  To win their love, or do them reverence.
207  They loved me so well, by God above,
208  That I reckoned little of their love!
209  A wise woman will be constantly busy
210  To get their love, yes, when she has none.
211  But since I had them wholly in my hand,
212  And since they had me given all their land,
213  Why should I take care to please them,
214  Unless it were for my profit and my pleasure?
215  I set them so to work, by my faith,
216  That many a night they sang `Woe is me!'
217  The bacon was not fetched for them, I believe,
218  That some men have in Essex at Dunmowe.
219  I governed them so well, according to my law,
220  That each of them was very blissful and eager
221  To bring me gay things from the fair.
222  They were very glad when I spoke to them pleasantly,
223  For, God knows it, I cruelly scolded them.

224  Now listen how well I conducted myself,
225  You wise wives, that can understand.
226  Thus should you speak and accuse them wrongfully,
227  For half so boldly can there no man
228  Swear and lie, as a woman can.
229  I do not say this concerning wives that are wise,
230  Unless it be when they are ill advised.
231  A wise wife, if she knows what is good for her,
232  Shall deceive him by swearing the bird is crazy,
233  And prove it by taking witness of her own maid
234  Who is in league with her. But listen how I spoke:

235  `Sir old doddering fool, is this thy doing?
236  Why is my neighbor's wife so gay?
237  She is honored everywhere she goes;
238  I sit at home; I have no decent clothing.
239  What dost thou at my neighbor's house?
240  Is she so fair? Art thou so amorous?
241  What do you whisper with our maid? Bless me!
242  Sir old lecher, let thy tricks be!
243  And if I have a close friend or an acquaintance,
244  Innocently, thou scold like a fiend,
245  If I walk or go unto his house to amuse myself!
246  Thou comest home as drunk as a mouse,
247  And preach on thy bench, bad luck to you!
248  Thou sayest to me it is a great misfortune
249  To wed a poor woman, because of expense;
250  And if she be rich, of high birth,
251  Then thou sayest that it is a torment
252  To put up with her pride and her angry moods.
253  And if she be fair, thou utter knave,
254  Thou sayest that every lecher wants to have her;
255  She can not remain chaste for any length of time,
256  Who is assailed on every side.

257  Thou sayest some folk desire us for riches,
258  Some for our shape, and some for our fairness,
259  And one because she can either sing or dance,
260  And some because of noble descent and flirtatious talk;
261  Some because of their hands and their slender arms;
262  Thus goes all to the devil, according to you.
263  Thou sayest men may not defend a castle wall,
264  It may so long be assailed on all sides.

265  And if she be ugly, thou sayest that she
266  Covets every man that she may see,
267  For like a spaniel she will on him leap,
268  Until she find some man to buy (take) her.
269  Nor does any goose go there in the lake, no matter how drab,
270  That, thou sayest, will be without a mate.
271  And thou sayest it is a hard thing to control
272  A thing that no man will, willingly, hold.
273  Thus sayest thou, scoundrel, when thou goest to bed,
274  And that no wise man needs to wed,
275  Nor any man that hopes (to go) to heaven.
276  With wild thunder-bolt and fiery lightning
277  May thy wrinkled neck be broken in pieces!

278  Thou sayest that leaky houses, and also smoke,
279  And scolding wives make men to flee
280  Out of their own houses; ah, bless me!
281  What ails such an old man to chide like that?

282  Thou sayest we wives will hide our vices
283  Until we be securely tied (in marriage), and then we will them show --
284  Well may that be a proverb of a scoundrel!

285  Thou sayest that oxen, asses, horses, and hounds,
286  They are tried out a number of times;
287  Basins, wash bowls, before men them buy,
288  Spoons and stools, and all such household items,
289  And so are pots, clothes, and adornments;
290  But folk of wives make no trial,
291  Until they are wedded -- old doddering scoundrel! --
292  And then, sayest thou, we will show our vices.

293  Thou sayest also that it displeases me
294  Unless thou will praise my beauty,
295  And unless thou peer always upon my face,
296  And call me "dear lady" in every place.
297  And unless thou make a feast on that same day
298  That I was born, and make me happy and gay;
299  And unless thou do honor to my nurse,
300  And to my chambermaid within my bedchamber,
301  And to my father's folk and his allies --
302  Thus sayest thou, old barrelful of lies!

303  And yet of our apprentice Janekin,
304  Because of his curly hair, shining like gold so fine,
305  And because he familiarly attends me everywhere,
306  Yet hast thou caught a false suspicion.
307  I do not want him, though thou were dead tomorrow!

308  But tell me this: why hidest thou, bad luck to you,
309  The keys of thy strongbox away from me?
310  It is my property as well as thine, by God!
311  What, think thou to make a fool of the lady of the house?
312  Now by that lord that is called Saint James,
313  Thou shalt not both, though thou were crazy with anger,
314  Be master of my body and of my property;
315  One of them thou must give up, despite anything you can do.
316  What helps it to inquire about me or spy?
317  I believe thou would lock me in thy strongbox!
318  Thou should say, "Wife, go where you please;
319  Enjoy yourself; I will not believe any gossip.
320  I know you for a true wife, dame Alys."
321  We love no man who takes notice or concern about
322  Where we go; we will be free (to do as we wish).

323  Of all men blessed may he be,
324  The wise astrologer, Dan Ptolemy,
325  Who says this proverb in his Almagest:
326  "Of all men his wisdom is the highest
327  Who never cares who has the world in his control."
328  By this proverb thou shalt understand,
329  If thou have enough, why should thou take note or care
330  How merrily other folks fare?
331  For, certainly, old senile fool, by your leave,
332  You shall have pudendum right enough at eve.
333  He is too great a miser that would refuse
334  A man to light a candle at his lantern;
335  He shall have never the less light, by God.
336  If thou have enough, thou need not complain.

337  Thou sayest also, that if we make ourselves gay
338  With clothing, and with precious adornments,
339  That it is dangerous to our chastity;
340  And yet -- bad luck to thee! -- thou must reinforce thy argument,
341  And say these words in the Apostle's name:
342  "In clothing made with chastity and shame
343  You women shall apparel yourselves," he said,
344  "And not in carefully arranged hair and gay precious stones,
345  Such as pearls, nor with gold, nor rich cloth."
346  In accordance with thy text, nor in accord with thy interpretation,
347  I will not do as much as a gnat.

348  Thou said this, that I was like a cat;
349  For if anyone would singe a cat's skin,
350  Then would the cat well stay in his dwelling;
351  And if the cat's skin be sleek and gay,
352  She will not stay in house half a day,
353  But forth she will (go), before any day be dawned,
354  To show her skin and go yowling like a cat in heat.
355  This is to say, if I be well dressed, sir scoundrel,
356  I will run out to show my poor clothes.

357  Sir old fool, what help is it for thee to spy?
358  Though thou pray Argus with his hundred eyes
359  To be my bodyguard, as he best knows how,
360  In faith, he shall not keep me but as I please;
361  Yet could I deceive him, as I may prosper!

362  Thou said also that there are three things,
363  The which things trouble all this earth,
364  And that no one can endure the fourth.
365  O dear sir scoundrel, Jesus shorten thy life!
366  Yet thou preachest and sayest a hateful wife
367  Is reckoned as one of these misfortunes.
368  Are there no other sorts of comparisons
369  That you can use in your sayings,
370  Without a poor wife's being one of them?

371  Thou also compare women's love to hell,
372  To barren land, where water may not remain.
373  Thou compare it also to Greek (inextinguishable) fire;
374  The more it burns, the more it has desire
375  To consume every thing that will be burned.
376  Thou sayest, just as worms destroy a tree,
377  Right so a wife destroys her husband;
378  This know they who are bound to wives.'

379  Gentlemen, right thus, as you have heard,
380  I firmly swore to my old husbands
381  That thus they said in their drunkenness;
382  And all was false, but I took witness
383  On Janekin, and on my niece also.
384  O Lord! The pain I did them and the woe,
385  Entirely guiltless (they were), by God's sweet pain!
386  For like a horse I could bite and whinny.
387  I could complain, and yet was in the wrong,
388  Or else many times had I been ruined.
389  Whoever first comes to the mill, first grinds;
390  I complained first, so was our war ended.
391  They were very glad to excuse themselves quickly
392  Of things of which they were never guilty in their lives.
393  Of wenches would I falsely accuse them,
394  When for sickness they could hardly stand.

395  Yet I tickled his heart, for he
396  Believed that I had of him so great affection!
397  I swore that all my walking out by night
398  Was to spy out wenches with whom he had intercourse;
399  Under that pretense I had many a mirth.
400  For all such wit is given us in our birth;
401  Deceit, weeping, spinning God has given
402  To women naturally, while they may live.
403  And thus of one thing I boast:
404  At the end I had the better in every way,
405  By trickery, or force, or by some such thing,
406  As by continual grumbling or grouching.
407  Especially in bed they had misfortune:
408  There would I scold and do them no pleasure;
409  I would no longer in the bed abide,
410  If I felt his arm over my side,
411  Until he had paid his penalty to me;
412  Then would I allow him to do his foolishness.
413  And therefore this tale I tell to every man,
414  Anyone can profit, for everything is for sale;
415  One can lure no hawks with an empty hand.
416  For profit I would endure all his lust,
417  And make me a feigned appetite;
418  And yet in bacon (old meat) I never had delight.
419  That made me so that I would always scold them,
420  For though the pope had sat beside them,
421  I would not spare them at their own table,
422  For, by my troth, I paid them back word for word.
423  As help me true God omnipotent,
424  Though I right now should make my will,
425  I owe them not one word that has not been avenged.
426  I brought it so about by my wit
427  That they had to give it up, as the best they could do,
428  Or else had we never been at peace;
429  For though he looked like a furious lion,
430  Yet should he fail to attain his goal.

431  Then I would say, `Sweetheart, see
432  How meekly looks Willy, our sheep!
433  Come near, my spouse, let me kiss thy cheek!
434  You should be all patient and meek,
435  And have a sweet tender disposition,
436  Since you so preach of Job's patience.
437  Suffer always, since you so well can preach;
438  And unless you do, certainly we shall teach you
439  That it is fair to have a wife in peace.
440  One of us two must bow, doubtless,
441  And since a man is more reasonable
442  Than a woman is, you must be able to bear suffering.
443  What ails you to grouch thus and groan?
444  Is it because you want to have my pudendum all to yourself?
445  Why, take it all! Lo, have it every bit!
446  By Saint Peter! I would curse you, if you did not love it well;
447  For if I would sell my `pretty thing,'
448  I could walk as fresh (newly clothed) as is a rose;
449  But I will keep it for your own pleasure.
450  You are to blame, by God! I tell you the truth.'

451  Such sorts of words we had in hand.
452  Now will I speak of my fourth husband.

453  My fourth husband was a reveller --
454  This is to say, he had a mistress --
455  And I was young and full of playfulness,
456  Stubborn and strong, and jolly as a magpie.
457  How well I could dance to a small harp,
458  And sing, indeed, like any nightingale,
459  When I had drunk a draft of sweet wine!
460  Metellius, the foul churl, the swine,
461  Who with a staff deprived his wife of her life,
462  Because she drank wine, if I had been his wife,
463  He should not have frightened me away from drink!
464  And after wine on Venus must I think,
465  For as surely as cold engenders hail,
466  A gluttonous mouth must have a lecherous tail.
467  In drunken women there is no defense --
468  This lechers know by experience.

469  But -- Lord Christ! -- when I remember
470  My youth, and my gaiety,
471  It tickles me to the bottom of my heart.
472  Unto this day it does my heart good
473  That I have had my world in my time.
474  But age, alas, that all will poison,
475  Has deprived me of my beauty and my vigor.
476  Let it go. Farewell! The devil go with it!
477  The flour is gone; there is no more to tell;
478  The bran, as I best can, now I must sell;
479  But yet I will try to be right merry.
480  Now will I tell of my fourth husband.

481  I say, I had in heart great anger
482  That he had delight in any other.
483  But he was paid back, by God and by Saint Joce!
484  I made him a cross of the same wood;
485  Not of my body, in no foul manner,
486  But certainly, I treated folk in such a way
487  That I made him fry in his own grease
488  For anger, and for pure jealousy.
489  By God, in earth I was his purgatory,
490  For which I hope his soul may be in glory.
491  For, God knows it, he sat very often and cried out in pain,
492  When his shoe very bitterly pinched him.
493  There was no person who knew it, save God and he,
494  In many a way, how painfully I tortured him.
495  He died when I came from Jerusalem,
496  And lies buried under the rood beam,
497  Although his tomb is not so elaborate
498  As was the sepulcher of that Darius,
499  Which Appelles wrought skillfully;
500  It is nothing but waste to bury him expensively.
501  Let him fare well; God give his soul rest!
502  He is now in his grave and in his casket.

503  Now of my fifth husband I will tell.
504  God let his soul never come in hell!
505  And yet he was to me the greatest scoundrel;
506  That feel I on my ribs one after another,
507  And ever shall unto my final day.
508  But in our bed he was so lively and gay,
509  And moreover he so well could deceive me,
510  When he would have my `pretty thing';
511  That though he had beat me on every bone,
512  He could win back my love straightway.
513  I believe I loved him best, because he
514  Was of his love standoffish to me.
515  We women have, if I shall not lie,
516  In this matter a curious fantasy:
517  Note that whatever thing we may not easily have,
518  We will cry all day and crave for it.
519  Forbid us a thing, and we desire it;
520  Press on us fast, and then will we flee.
521  With niggardliness we spread out all our merchandise;
522  A great crowd at the market makes wares expensive,
523  And too great a supply makes them of little value:
524  Every woman that is wise knows this.

525  My fifth husband -- God bless his soul! --
526  Whom I took for love, and no riches,
527  He was formerly a clerk of Oxford,
528  And had left school, and came home to board
529  With my close friend, dwelling in our town;
530  God have her soul! Her name was Alisoun.
531  She knew my heart, and also my secrets,
532  Better than our parish priest, as I may prosper!
533  To her I revealed all my secrets.
534  For had my husband pissed on a wall,
535  Or done a thing that should have cost his life,
536  To her, and to another worthy wife,
537  And to my niece, whom I loved well,
538  I would have told every one of his secrets.
539  And so I did very often, God knows it,
540  That made his face often red and hot
541  For true shame, and blamed himself because he
542  Had told to me so great a secret.

543  And so it happened that once in a Springtime --
544  Since frequently I went to visit my close friend,
545  For I always loved to be gay,
546  And to walk in March, April, and May,
547  From house to house, to hear various bits of gossip --
548  That Jankin the clerk, and my close friend dame Alys,
549  And I myself, into the fields went.
550  My husband was at London all that Spring;
551  I had the better opportunity to amuse myself,
552  And to see, and also to be seen
553  By amorous folk. What did I know about where my good fortune
554  Was destined to be, or in what place?
555  Therefore I made my visitations
556  To religious feasts and to processions,
557  To preaching also, and to these pilgrimages,
558  To plays about miracles, and to marriages,
559  And wore my gay scarlet robes.
560  These worms, nor these moths, nor these mites,
561  Upon my peril (I swear), chewed on them never a bit;
562  And know thou why? Because they were well used.

563  Now will I tell forth what happened to me.
564  I say that in the fields we walked,
565  Until truly we had such flirtation,
566  This clerk and I, that for my provision for the future
567  I spoke to him and said to him how he,
568  If I were a widow, should wed me.
569  For certainly -- I say this for no boast --
570  I was never yet without providing beforehand
571  For marriage, nor for other things also.
572  I hold a mouse's heart not worth a leek
573  That has but one hole to flee to,
574  If that should fail, then all is lost.

575  I falsely swore that he had enchanted me --
576  My mother taught me that trick --
577  And also I said I dreamed of him all night,
578  He would have slain me as I lay on my back,
579  And all my bed was full of real blood;
580  `But yet I hope that you shall do me good,
581  For blood symbolizes gold, as I was taught.'
582  And all was false; I dreamed of it not at all,
583  But I followed always my mother's teaching,
584  As well in this as in other things more.

585  But now, sir, let me see what I shall say.
586  A ha! By God, I have my tale again.

587  When my fourth husband was on the funeral bier,
588  I wept continuously, and acted sorry,
589  As wives must do, for it is the custom,
590  And with my kerchief covered my face,
591  But because I was provided with a mate,
592  I wept but little, and that I affirm.

593  To church was my husband carried in the morning
594  By neighbors, who for him made sorrow;
595  And Jankin, our clerk, was one of those.
596  As help me God, when I saw him go
597  After the bier, I thought he had a pair
598  Of legs and of feet so neat and fair
599  That all my heart I gave unto his keeping.
600  He was, I believe, twenty years old,
601  And I was forty, if I shall tell the truth;
602  But yet I had always a colt's tooth.
603  With teeth set wide apart I was, and that became me well;
604  I had the print of Saint Venus's seal.
605  As help me God, I was a lusty one,
606  And fair, and rich, and young, and well fixed,
607  And truly, as my husbands told me,
608  I had the best pudendum that might be.
609  For certainly, I am all influenced by Venus
610  In feeling, and my heart is influenced by Mars.
611  Venus me gave my lust, my amorousness,
612  And Mars gave me my sturdy boldness;
613  My ascendant was Taurus, and Mars was therein.
614  Alas, alas! That ever love was sin!
615  I followed always my inclination
616  By virtue of the state of the heavens at my birth;
617  That made me that I could not withdraw
618  My chamber of Venus from a good fellow.
619  Yet have I Mars' mark upon my face,
620  And also in another private place.
621  For as God may be my salvation,
622  I never loved in moderation,
623  But always followed my appetite,
624  Whether he were short, or tall, or black-haired, or blond;
625  I took no notice, provided that he pleased me,
626  How poor he was, nor also of what rank.

627  What should I say but, at the month's end,
628  This jolly clerk, Jankin, that was so courteous,
629  Has wedded me with great solemnity,
630  And to him I gave all the land and property
631  That ever was given to me before then.
632  But afterward I repented very bitterly;
633  He would not allow me anything of my desires.
634  By God, he hit me once on the ear,
635  Because I tore a leaf out of his book,
636  So that of the stroke my ear became all deaf.
637  I was as stubborn as is a lioness,
638  And of my tongue a true chatterbox,
639  And I would walk, as I had done before,
640  From house to house, although he had sworn the contrary;
641  For which he often times would preach,
642  And teach me of old Roman stories;
643  How he, Simplicius Gallus, left his wife,
644  And forsook her for rest of all his life,
645  Because of nothing but because he saw her bare-headed
646  Looking out at his door one day.

647  Another Roman he told me by name,
648  Who, because his wife was at a midsummer revel
649  Without his knowledge, he forsook her also.
650  And then he would seek in his Bible
651  That same proverb of Ecclesiasticus
652  Where he commands and strictly forbids that
653  Man should suffer his wife go wander about.
654  Then would he say right thus, without doubt:

655  `Whoever builds his house all of willow twigs,
656  And spurs his blind horse over the open fields,
657  And suffers his wife to go on pilgrimages,
658  Is worthy to be hanged on the gallows!'
659  But all for nothing, I gave not a hawthorn berry
660  For his proverbs nor for his old sayings,
661  Nor would I be corrected by him.
662  I hate him who tells me my vices,
663  And so do more of us, God knows, than I.
664  This made him all utterly furious with me;
665  I would not put up with him in any way.

666  Now will I tell you the truth, by Saint Thomas,
667  Why I tore a leaf out of his book,
668  For which he hit me so hard that I was deaf.

669  He had a book that regularly, night and day,
670  For his amusement he would always read;
671  He called it Valerie and Theofrastus,
672  At which book he always heartily laughed.
673  And also there was once a clerk at Rome,
674  A cardinal, who is called Saint Jerome,
675  That made a book against Jovinian;
676  In which book also there was Tertullian,
677  Crisippus, Trotula, and Heloise,
678  Who was abbess not far from Paris,
679  And also the Parables of Salomon,
680  Ovid's Art, and many other books,
681  And all these were bound in one volume.
682  And every night and day was his custom,
683  When he had leisure and spare time
684  From other worldly occupations,
685  To read in this book of wicked wives.
686  He knew of them more legends and lives
687  Than are of good women in the Bible.
688  For trust well, it is an impossibility
689  That any clerk will speak good of women,
690  Unless it be of holy saints' lives,
691  Nor of any other woman in any way.
692  Who painted the lion, tell me who?
693  By God, if women had written stories,
694  As clerks have within their studies,
695  They would have written of men more wickedness
696  Than all the male sex could set right.
697  The children of Mercury (clerks) and of Venus (lovers)
698  Are directly contrary in their actions;
699  Mercury loves wisdom and knowledge,
700  And Venus loves riot and extravagant expenditures.
701  And, because of their diverse dispositions,
702  Each falls in the other's most powerful astronomical sign.
703  And thus, God knows, Mercury is powerless
704  In Pisces (the Fish), where Venus is exalted,
705  And Venus falls where Mercury is raised.
706  Therefore no woman is praised by any clerk.
707  The clerk, when he is old, and can not do
708  Any of Venus's works worth his old shoe,
709  Then he sits down, and writes in his dotage
710  That women can not keep their marriage!

711  But now to the point, why I told thee
712  That I was beaten for a book, by God!
713  Upon a night Jankin, that was master of our house,
714  Read on his book, as he sat by the fire,
715  Of Eve first, how for her wickedness
716  All mankind was brought to wretchedness,
717  For which Jesus Christ himself was slain,
718  Who bought us back with his heart's blood.
719  Lo, here clearly of woman you may find
720  That woman was the cause of the loss of all mankind.

721  Then he read me how Sampson lost his hair:
722  Sleeping, his lover cut it with her shears;
723  Through which treason he lost both his eyes.
724  Then he read to me, if I shall not lie,
725  Of Hercules and of his Dianyre,
726  Who caused him to set himself on fire.

727  He forgot not a bit of the care and the woe
728  That Socrates had with his two wives,
729  How Xantippa caste piss upon his head.
730  This poor man sat still as if he were dead;
731  He wiped his head, no more dared he say,
732  But `Before thunder stops, there comes a rain!'

733  Of Phasipha, that was the queen of Crete,
734  For sheer malignancy, he thought the tale sweet;
735  Fie! Speak no more -- it is a grisly thing --
736  Of her horrible lust and her pleasure.

737  Of Clitermystra, for her lechery,
738  That falsely made her husband to die,
739  He read it with very good devotion.

740  He told me also for what occasion
741  Amphiorax at Thebes lost his life.
742  My husband had a legend of his wife,
743  Eriphilem, that for a brooch of gold
744  Has secretly unto the Greeks told
745  Where her husband hid him in a place,
746  For which he had at Thebes a sad fate.

747  Of Livia told he me, and of Lucie:
748  They both made their husbands to die,
749  That one for love, that other was for hate.
750  Livia her husband, on a late evening,
751  Has poisoned, because she was his foe;
752  Lucia, lecherous, loved her husband so much
753  That, so that he should always think upon her,
754  She gave him such a sort of love-drink
755  That he was dead before it was morning;
756  And thus always husbands have sorrow.

757  Then he told me how one Latumius
758  Complained unto his fellow Arrius
759  That in his garden grew such a tree
760  On which he said how his three wives
761  Hanged themselves for the malice of their hearts
762  `O dear brother,' this Arrius said,
763  `Give me a shoot of that same blessed tree,
764  And in my garden shall it be planted.'

765  Of latter date, of wives has he read
766  That some have slain their husbands in their bed,
767  And let her lecher copulate with her all the night,
768  When the corpse lay in the floor flat on its back.
769  And some have driven nails in their brains,
770  While they slept, and thus they had them slain.
771  Some have given them poison in their drink.
772  He spoke more harm than heart may imagine,
773  And concerning this he knew of more proverbs
774  Than in this world there grow grass or herbs.
775  Beeris, 'he said, they habitation
776  Be with a lion or a foul dragon,
777  Than with a woman accustomed to scold.
778  Better is,' he said, `to stay high in the roof,
779  Than with an angry wife down in the house;
780  They are so wicked and contrary,
781  They always hate what their husbands love.'
782  He said, `A woman casts their shame away,
783  When she casts off her undergarment'; and furthermore,
784  `A fair woman, unless she is also chaste,
785  Is like a gold ring in a sow's nose.'
786  Who would believe, or who would suppose,
787  The woe that in my heart was, and pain?

788  And when I saw he would never cease
789  Reading on this cursed book all night,
790  All suddenly have I plucked three leaves
791  Out of his book, right as he read, and also
792  I with my fist so hit him on the cheek
793  That in our fire he fell down backwards.
794  And he leaped up as does a furious lion,
795  And with his fist he hit me on the head
796  That on the floor I lay as if I were dead.
797  And when he saw how still I lay,
798  He was frightened and would have fled on his way,
799  Until at the last out of my swoon I awoke.
800  `O! hast thou slain me, false thief?' I said,
801  `And for my land thus hast thou murdered me?
802  Before I am dead, yet will I kiss thee.'

803  And near he came, and kneeled gently down,
804  And said, `Dear sister Alisoun,
805  So help me God, I shall never (again) smite thee!
806  What I have done, it is thyself to blame (you drove me to it).
807  Forgive it me, and that I beseech thee!'
808  And yet immediately I hit him on the cheek,
809  And said, `Thief, thus much am I avenged;
810  Now will I die, I may no longer speak.'
811  But at the last, with much care and woe,
812  We made an agreement between our two selves.
813  He gave me all the control in my hand,
814  To have the governance of house and land,
815  And of his tongue, and of his hand also;
816  And made him burn his book immediately right then.
817  And when I had gotten unto me,
818  By mastery, all the sovereignty,
819  And that he said, `My own true wife,
820  Do as you please the rest of all thy life;
821  Guard thy honor, and guard also my reputation' --
822  After that day we never had an argument.
823  As God may help me, I was to him as kind
824  As any wife from Denmark unto India,
825  And also true, and so was he to me.
826  I pray to God, who sits in majesty,
827  So bless his soul for his mercy dear.
828  Now will I say my tale, if you will hear."

Beholde the wordes bitwene the
Somonour and the Frere

829  The Friar laughed, when he had heard all this;
830  "Now dame, he said, "as I may have joy or bliss,
831  This is a long preamble of a tale!"
832  And when the Summoner heard the Friar cry out,
833  "Lo," said the Summoner, "By God's two arms!
834  A friar will always intrude himself (in others' affairs).
835  Lo, good men, a fly and also a friar
836  Will fall in every dish and also every discussion.
837  What speakest thou of perambulation?
838  What! amble, or trot, or keep still, or go sit down!
839  Thou spoil our fun in this manner."

840  "Yes, wilt thou have it thus, sir Summoner?" said the Friar;
841  "Now, by my faith I shall, before I go,
842  Tell of a summoner such a tale or two
843  That all the folk shall laugh in this place."

844  "Now otherwise, Friar, I curse thy face,"
845  Said this Summoner, "and I curse myself,
846  Unless I tell tales two or three
847  Of friars before I come to Siitingbourne
848  That I shall make thy heart to mourn,
849  For well I know thy patience is gone."

850  Our Host cried "Peace! And that right now!"
851  And said, "Let the woman tell her tale.
852  You act like folk that are drunk on ale.
853  Do, dame, tell forth your tale, and that is best."

854  "All ready, sir," she said, "right as you please,
855  If I have permission of this worthy Friar."

856  "Yes, dame," he said, "tell forth, and I will hear."



Heere endeth the Wyf of Bathe hir Prologe

The Wife of Bath's Tale

Heere bigynneth the Tale of the Wyf of Bathe

857  In the old days of King Arthur,
858  Of whom Britons speak great honor,
859  This land was all filled full of supernatural creatures.
860  The elf-queen, with her jolly company,
861  Danced very often in many a green mead.
862  This was the old belief, as I read;
863  I speak of many hundred years ago.
864  But now no man can see any more elves,
865  For now the great charity and prayers
866  Of licensed beggars and other holy friars,
867  That overrun every land and every stream,
868  As thick as specks of dust in the sun-beam,
869  Blessing halls, chambers, kitchens, bedrooms,
870  Cities, towns, castles, high towers,
871  Villages, barns, stables, dairies --
872  This makes it that there are no fairies.
873  For where an elf was accustomed to walk
874  There walks now the licensed begging friar himself
875  In late mornings and in early mornings,
876  And says his morning prayers and his holy things
877  As he goes in his assigned district.
878  Women may go safely up and down.
879  In every bush or under every tree
880  There is no other evil spirit but he,
881  And he will not do them any harm except dishonor.

882  And so it happened that this king Arthur
883  Had in his house a lusty bachelor,
884  That on one day came riding from hawking,
885  And it happened that, alone as he was born,
886  He saw a maiden walking before him,
887  Of which maiden straightway, despite all she could do,
888  By utter force, he took away her maidenhead;
889  For which wrong was such clamor
890  And such demand for justice unto king Arthur
891  That this knight was condemned to be dead,
892  By course of law, and should have lost his head --
893  Perhaps such was the statute then --
894  Except that the queen and other ladies as well
895  So long prayed the king for grace
896  Until he granted him his life right there,
897  And gave him to the queen, all at her will,
898  To choose whether she would him save or put to death.

899  The queen thanks the king with all her might,
900  And after this she spoke thus to the knight,
901  When she saw her time, upon a day:
902  "Thou standest yet," she said, "in such condition,
903  That of thy life yet thou hast no assurance
904  I grant thee life, if thou canst tell me
905  What thing it is that women most desire.
906  Beware, and keep thy neck-bone from iron (axe)!
907  And if thou canst not tell it right now,
908  Yet I will give thee leave to go
909  A twelvemonth and a day, to seek to learn
910  A satisfactory answer in this matter;
911  And I will have, before thou go, a pledge
912  To surrender thy body in this place."

913  Woe was this knight, and sorrowfully he sighs;
914  But what! He can not do all as he pleases.
915  And at the last he chose to leave
916  And come again, exactly at the year's end,
917  With such answer as God would provide him;
918  And takes his leave, and goes forth on his way.

919  He seeks every house and every place
920  Where he hopes to have the luck
921  To learn what thing women love most,
922  But he could not arrive in any region
923  Where he might find in this matter
924  Two creatures agreeing together.
925  Some said women love riches best,
926  Some said honor, some said gaiety,
927  Some rich clothing, some said lust in bed,
928  And frequently to be widow and wedded.
929  Some said that our hearts are most eased
930  When we are flattered and pleased.
931  He goes very near the truth, I will not lie.
932  A man shall win us best with flattery,
933  And with attentions and with solicitude
934  We are caught, every one of us.

935  And some say that we love best
936  To be free and do just as we please,
937  And that no man reprove us for our vices,
938  But say that we are wise and not at all silly.
939  For truly there is not one of us all,
940  If any one will scratch us on the sore spot,
941  That we will not kick back, because he tells us the truth.
942  Try it, and whoever so does shall find it true;
943  For, be we never so vicious within,
944  We want to be considered wise and clean of sin.

945  And some say that we have great delight
946  To be considered steadfast, and also (able to keep a) secret,
947  And in one purpose steadfastly to remain,
948  And not reveal things that men tell us.
949  But that tale is not worth a rake handle.
950  By God, we women can hide nothing;
951  Witness on Midas -- will you hear the tale?

952  Ovid, among other small matters,
953  Said Midas had, under his long hair,
954  Two ass's ears, growing upon his head,
955  The which vice he hid as he best could
956  Very skillfully from every man's sight,
957  That, except for his wife, there knew of it no others.
958  He loved her most, and trusted her also;
959  He prayed her that to no creature
960  She should tell of his disfigurement.

961  She swore him, "Nay"; for all this world to win,
962  She would not do that dishonor or sin,
963  To make her husband have so foul a reputation.
964  She would not tell it for her own shame.
965  But nonetheless, she thought that she would die
966  If she should hide a secret so long;
967  She thought it swelled so sore about her heart
968  That necessarily some word must escape her;
969  And since she dared tell it to no man,
970  She ran down to a marsh close by --
971  Until she came there her heart was afire --
972  And as a bittern bumbles in the mire,
973  She laid her mouth down unto the water:
974  "Betray me not, thou water, with thy sound,"
975  She said; "to thee I tell it and no others;
976  My husband has two long asses ears!
977  Now is my heart all whole; now is it out.
978  I could no longer keep it, without doubt."
979  Here you may see, though we a time abide,
980  Yet out it must come; we can hide no secret.
981  The remnant of the tale if you will hear,
982  Read Ovid, and there you may learn it.

983  This knight, of whom my tale is in particular,
984  When he saw he might not come to that --
985  This is to say, what women love most --
986  Within his breast very sorrowful was the spirit.
987  But home he goes; he could not linger;
988  The day was come that homeward he must turn.
989  And in his way he happened to ride,
990  In all this care, near a forest side,
991  Where he saw upon a dance go
992  Ladies four and twenty, and yet more;
993  Toward the which dance he drew very eagerly,
994  In hope that he should learn some wisdom.
995  But certainly, before he came fully there,
996  Vanished was this dance, he knew not where.
997  He saw no creature that bore life,
998  Save on the green he saw sitting a woman --
999  There can no man imagine an uglier creature.
1000  At the knight's coming this old wife did rise,
1001  And said, "Sir knight, there lies no road out of here.
1002  Tell me what you seek, by your faith!
1003  Perhaps it may be the better;
1004  These old folk know many things," she said.

1005  "My dear mother," said this knight, "certainly
1006  I am as good as dead unless I can say
1007  What thing it is that women most desire.
1008  If you could teach me, I would well repay you."

1009  "Pledge me thy word here in my hand," she said,
1010  "The next thing that I require of thee,
1011  Thou shalt do it, if it lies in thy power,
1012  And I will tell it to you before it is night."

1013  "Have here my pledged word," said the knight, "I agree."
1014  "Then," she said, "I dare me well boast
1015  Thy life is safe, for I will stand thereby;
1016  Upon my life, the queen will say as I.
1017  Let's see which is the proudest of them all
1018  That wears a kerchief or a hairnet
1019  That dares say `nay' of what I shall teach thee.
1020  Let us go forth without longer speech."
1021  Then she whispered a message in his ear,
1022  And commanded him to be glad and have no fear.
1023  When they are come to the court, this knight
1024  Said he had held his day, as he had promised,
1025  And his answer was ready, as he said.
1026  Very many a noble wife, and many a maid,
1027  And many a widow, because they are wise,
1028  The queen herself sitting as a justice,
1029  Are assembled, to hear his answer;
1030  And afterward this knight was commanded to appear.

1031  Silence was commanded to every person,
1032  And that the knight should tell in open court
1033  What thing (it is) that worldly women love best.
1034  This knight stood not silent as does a beast,
1035  But to his question straightway answered
1036  With manly voice, so that all the court heard it:

1037  "My liege lady, without exception," he said,
1038  "Women desire to have sovereignty
1039  As well over her husband as her love,
1040  And to be in mastery above him.
1041  This is your greatest desire, though you kill me.
1042  Do as you please; I am here subject to your will."
1043  In all the court there was not wife, nor maid,
1044  Nor widow that denied what he said,
1045  But said that he was worthy to have his life.
1046  And with that word up sprang the old woman,
1047  Whom the knight saw sitting on the green:
1048  "Mercy," she said, "my sovereign lady queen!
1049  Before your court departs, do me justice.
1050  I taught this answer to the knight;
1051  For which he pledged me his word there,
1052  The first thing that I would ask of him
1053  He would do, if it lay in his power.
1054  Before the court then I pray thee, sir knight,"
1055  Said she, "that thou take me as thy wife,
1056  For well thou know that I have saved thy life.
1057  If I say false, say `nay', upon thy faith!"

1058  This knight answered, "Alas and woe is me!
1059  I know right well that such was my promise.
1060  For God's love, choose a new request!
1061  Take all my goods and let my body go."

1062  "Nay, then," she said, "I curse both of us two!
1063  For though I am ugly, and old, and poor
1064  I would not for all the metal, nor for ore
1065  That under earth is buried or lies above,
1066  Have anything except that I were thy wife, and also thy love."

1067  "My love?" he said, "nay, my damnation!
1068  Alas, that any of my family
1069  Should ever be so foully degraded!"
1070  But all for naught; the end is this, that he
1071  Constrained was; he must by necessity wed her,
1072  And takes his old wife, and goes to bed.

1073  Now would some men say, perhaps,
1074  That because of my negligence I make no effort
1075  To tell you the joy and all the rich display
1076  That was at the (wedding) feast that same day.
1077  To which thing shortly I shall answer:
1078  I say there was no joy nor feast at all;
1079  There was nothing but heaviness and much sorrow.
1080  For he wedded her in private in the morning,
1081  And all day after hid himself like an owl,
1082  So woeful was he, his wife looked so ugly.

1083  Great was the woe the knight had in his thought,
1084  When he was brought to bed with his wife;
1085  He wallows and he turns to and fro.
1086  His old wife lay smiling evermore,
1087  And said, "O dear husband, bless me!
1088  Does every knight behave thus with his wife as you do?
1089  Is this the law of king Arthur's house?
1090  Is every knight of his so aloof?
1091  I am your own love and your wife;
1092  I am she who has saved your life,
1093  And, certainly, I did you never wrong yet;
1094  Why behave you thus with me this first night?
1095  You act like a man who had lost his wit.
1096  What is my offense? For God's love, tell it,
1097  And it shall be amended, if I can."

1098  "Amended?" said this knight, "Alas, nay, nay!
1099  It will not be amended ever more.
1100  Thou art so loathsome, and so old also,
1101  And moreover descended from such low born lineage,
1102  That little wonder is though I toss and twist about.
1103  So would God my heart would burst!"

1104  "Is this," she said, "the cause of your distress?"

1105  "Yes, certainly," he said, "it is no wonder."

1106  "Now, sir," she said, "I could amend all this,
1107  If I pleased, before three days were past,
1108  Providing that you might behave well towards me.

1109  "But, since you speak of such nobility
1110  As is descended out of old riches,
1111  That therefore you should be noble men,
1112  Such arrogance is not worth a hen.
1113  Look who is most virtuous always,
1114  In private and public, and most intends ever
1115  To do the noble deeds that he can;
1116  Take him for the greatest noble man.
1117  Christ wants us to claim our nobility from him,
1118  Not from our ancestors for their old riches.
1119  For though they give us all their heritage,
1120  For which we claim to be of noble lineage,
1121  Yet they can not bequeath by any means
1122  To any of us their virtuous living,
1123  That made them be called noble men,
1124  And commanded us to follow them in such matters.

1125  "Well can the wise poet of Florence,
1126  Who is called Dante, speak on this matter.
1127  Lo, in such sort of rime is Dante's speech:
1128  `Very seldom grows up from its small branches
1129  Nobility of man, for God, of his goodness,
1130  Wants us to claim our nobility from him';
1131  For from our ancestors we can claim no thing
1132  Except temporal things, that may hurt and injure a man.

1133  "Also every person knows this as well as I,
1134  If nobility were planted naturally
1135  Unto a certain lineage down the line,
1136  Then in private and in public they would never cease
1137  To do the just duties of nobility;
1138  They could do no dishonor or vice.

1139  "Take fire and bear it in the darkest house
1140  Between this and the mount of Caucasus,
1141  And let men shut the doors and go away;
1142  Yet will the fire as brightly blaze and burn
1143  As if twenty thousand men might it behold;
1144  Its natural function it will always hold,
1145  On peril of my life (I say), until it dies.

1146  "Here may you see well that nobility
1147  Is not joined with possession,
1148  Since folk not do behave as they should
1149  Always, as does the fire, lo, in its nature.
1150  For, God knows it, men may well often find
1151  A lord's son doing shame and dishonor;
1152  And he who will have praise for his noble birth,
1153  Because he was born of a noble house
1154  And had his noble and virtuous ancestors,
1155  And will not himself do any noble deeds
1156  Nor follow his noble ancestry that is dead,
1157  He is not noble, be he duke or earl,
1158  For churlish sinful deeds make a churl.
1159  For nobility is nothing but renown
1160  Of thy ancestors, for their great goodness,
1161  Which is a thing not naturally part of thy person.
1162  Thy nobility comes from God alone.
1163  Then our true nobility comes from grace ;
1164  It was not at all bequeathed to us with our social rank.

1165  "Think how noble, as says Valerius,
1166  Was that same Tullius Hostillius,
1167  That out of poverty rose to high nobility.
1168  Read Seneca, and read also Boethius;
1169  There shall you see clearly that it is no doubt
1170  That he is noble who does noble deeds.
1171  And therefore, dear husband, I thus conclude:
1172  Although it is so that my ancestors were rude,
1173  Yet may the high God, and so hope I,
1174  Grant me grace to live virtuously.
1175  Then am I noble, when I begin
1176  To live virtuously and abandon sin.

1177  "And whereas you reprove me for poverty,
1178  The high God, on whom we believe,
1179  In voluntary poverty chose to live his life.
1180  And certainly every man, maiden, or woman
1181  Can understand that Jesus, heaven's king,
1182  Would not choose a vicious form of living.
1183  Glad poverty is an honest thing, certain;
1184  This will Seneca and other clerks say.
1185  Whoever considers himself satisfied with his poverty,
1186  I consider him rich, although he had not a shirt.
1187  He who covets is a poor person,
1188  For he would have that which is not in his power;
1189  But he who has nothing, nor covets to have anything,
1190  Is rich, although you consider him but a knave.
1191  True poverty, it rightly sings;
1192  Juvenal says of poverty merrily:
1193  `The poor man, when he goes along the roadway,
1194  Before the thieves he may sing and play.'
1195  Poverty is a hateful good and, as I guess,
1196  A very great remover of cares;
1197  A great amender also of wisdom
1198  To him that takes it in patience.
1199  Poverty is this, although it may seem miserable:
1200  A possession that no one will challenge.
1201  Poverty very often, when a man is low,
1202  Makes him know his God and also himself.
1203  Poverty is an eye glass, as it seems to me,
1204  Through which one may see his true friends.
1205  And therefore, sir, since I do not injure you,
1206  You (should) no longer reprove me for my poverty.

1207  "Now, sir, of old age you reprove me;
1208  And certainly, sir, though no authority
1209  Were in any book, you gentlefolk of honor
1210  Say that men should be courteous to an old person
1211  And call him father, because of your nobility;
1212  And authors shall I find, as I guess.

1213  "Now where you say that I am ugly and old,
1214  Than do not fear to be a cuckold;
1215  For filth and old age, as I may prosper,
1216  Are great guardians of chastity.
1217  But nonetheless, since I know your delight,
1218  I shall fulfill your worldly appetite.

1219  "Choose now," she said, "one of these two things:
1220  To have me ugly and old until I die,
1221  And be to you a true, humble wife,
1222  And never displease you in all my life,
1223  Or else you will have me young and fair,
1224  And take your chances of the crowd
1225  That shall be at your house because of me,
1226  Or in some other place, as it may well be.
1227  Now choose yourself, whichever you please."

1228  This knight deliberates and painfully sighs,
1229  But at the last he said in this manner:
1230  "My lady and my love, and wife so dear,
1231  I put me in your wise governance;
1232  Choose yourself which may be most pleasure
1233  And most honor to you and me also.
1234  I do not care which of the two,
1235  For as it pleases you, is enough for me."

1236  "Then have I gotten mastery of you," she said,
1237  "Since I may choose and govern as I please?"

1238  "Yes, certainly, wife," he said, "I consider it best."

1239  "Kiss me," she said, "we are no longer angry,
1240  For, by my troth, I will be to you both --
1241  This is to say, yes, both fair and good.
1242  I pray to God that I may die insane
1243  Unless I to you be as good and true
1244  As ever was wife, since the world was new.
1245  And unless I am tomorrow morning as fair to be seen
1246  As any lady, empress, or queen,
1247  That is between the east and also the west,
1248  Do with my life and death right as you please.
1249  Cast up the curtain, look how it is."

1250  And when the knight saw truly all this,
1251  That she so was beautiful, and so young moreover,
1252  For joy he clasped her in his two arms.
1253  His heart bathed in a bath of bliss.
1254  A thousand time in a row he did her kiss,
1255  And she obeyed him in every thing
1256  That might do him pleasure or enjoyment.

1257  And thus they live unto their lives' end
1258  In perfect joy; and Jesus Christ us send
1259  Husbands meek, young, and vigorous in bed,
1260  And grace to outlive them whom we wed;
1261  And also I pray Jesus shorten their lives
1262  That will not be governed by their wives;
1263  And old and angry misers in spending,
1264  God send them soon the very pestilence!
